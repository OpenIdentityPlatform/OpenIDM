/**
 * An interface that provides uniform access methods on a set of objects. This interface
 * supports JSON-based structures that are composed of basic Java types: {@link Map}
 * (JSON object), {@link List} (JSON array), {@link String}, {@link Number}, {@link Boolean}.
 * <p>
 * Object identifiers are provided through the {@code id} parameter in methods, and in the
 * {@code _id} property within objects. In the case where {@code id} parameter is {@code null},
 * an operation is being requested on the entire object set.
 * <p>
 * If an object set is hierarchically organized, levels of hierarchy should be separated in
 * the {@code id} parameter using the {@code "/"} character. By convention, the {@code _id}
 * property value should be a leaf-level identifier (unqualified).
 * <p>
 * Implementations can elect to support optimistic concurrency. If so, an object's version is
 * provided through the {@code rev} parameter in methods, and in the {@code _rev} property
 * within objects. Consumers of this interface should provide object version in the {@code rev}
 * parameters if the {@code read} method yields objects that contain the {@code _rev} property.  
 * <p>
 * Implementations can reserve their own addition object property names with an underscore
 * {@code _} prefix.
