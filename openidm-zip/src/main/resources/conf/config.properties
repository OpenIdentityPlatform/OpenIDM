# Framework config properties.
#

# To override the packages the framework exports by default from the
# class path, set this variable.
#org.osgi.framework.system.packages=

# To append packages to the default set of exported system packages,
# set this value.
# org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra

# The following property makes specified packages from the class path
# available to all bundles. You should avoid using this property.
org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=sun.*,com.sun.*,apple.*,com.apple.*

# Felix tries to guess when to implicitly boot delegate in certain
# situations to ease integration without outside code. This feature
# is enabled by default, uncomment the following line to disable it.
#felix.bootdelegation.implicit=false

# The following property explicitly specifies the location of the bundle
# cache, which defaults to "felix-cache" in the current working directory.
# If this value is not absolute, then the felix.cache.rootdir controls
# how the absolute location is calculated. (See next property)
#org.osgi.framework.storage=${felix.cache.rootdir}/felix-cache

# The following property is used to convert a relative bundle cache
# location into an absolute one by specifying the root to prepend to
# the relative cache path. The default for this property is the
# current working directory.
#felix.cache.rootdir=${user.dir}

# The following property controls whether the bundle cache is flushed
# the first time the framework is initialized. Possible values are
# "none" and "onFirstInit"; the default is "none".
#org.osgi.framework.storage.clean=onFirstInit

# framework.service.urlhandlers - specifies whether or not to activate the URL Handlers
# service for the framework instance; the default value is "true",
# which results in the URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory() and
# URLConnection.setContentHandlerFactory() being called.


# The following property determines which actions are performed when
# processing the auto-deploy directory. It is a comma-delimited list of
# the following values: 'install', 'start', 'update', and 'uninstall'.
# An undefined or blank value is equivalent to disabling auto-deploy
# processing.
felix.auto.deploy.action=install,start

# The following property specifies the directory to use as the bundle
# auto-deploy directory; the default is 'bundle' in the working directory.
#felix.auto.deploy.dir=bundle

# The following property is a space-delimited list of bundle URLs
# to install when the framework starts. The ending numerical component
# is the target start level. Any number of these properties may be
# specified for different start levels.
#felix.auto.install.1=

# felix.log.logger - specifies an instance of org.apache.felix.framework.util.Logger
# that the framework uses as its default logger.

# The following property is a space-delimited list of bundle URLs
# to install and start when the framework starts. The ending numerical
# component is the target start level. Any number of these properties
# may be specified for different start levels.

# felix.log.level - specifies an integer String whose value indicates the degree of
# logging reported by the framework; the default value is "1" and "0" turns off logging completely,
# otherwise log levels match those specified in the OSGi Log Service
# (i.e., 1 = error, 2 = warning, 3 = information, and 4 = debug).
felix.log.level=1

# Sets the initial start level of the framework upon startup.
