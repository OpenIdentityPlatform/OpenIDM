The sample configuration connects to a local csv file. An example file is located at:

.../openidm/samples/sample4/data/Hr.csv

The idea of the sample is that the csv file is used as a feed for openidm. 
Threrefor no update should be written to the csv file by openidm and sync.json contains only one mappingg, from the csv file into the managed user objects.

uid is used as the unique id in the csv file and configured so in the provisioner configuration.
