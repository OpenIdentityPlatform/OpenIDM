The sample configuration connects to a local csv file. An example file is located at:

.../openidm/samples/sample4/data/Hr.csv

The idea of the sample is to demonstrate how a CSV file can be used as an authoratative source feed to OpenIDM. 
Therefor no updates should be written to the csv file by OpenIDM and sync.json contains only one mapping, from the csv file to the managed user object.

uid is used as the unique id in the csv file and configured so in the connector configuration.
