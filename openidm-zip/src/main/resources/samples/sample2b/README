The sample configuration connects to a local OpenDJ with the following paramers:

"host" : "localhost",
"port" : 1389,
"principal" : "cn=Directory Manager",
"credentials" : "password",

In opposite to sample2, this sample sync.json configuration contains two mappings from OpenDJ to OpenIDM and back. 
The number of attributes mapped are still rather limited. 
It contains a scheduler configuration which can be used to schedule reconciliation.
New users will be created from LDAP or existing will be updated and back-linked from OpenIDM to OpenDJ
Changes on OpenIDM will now be pushed into the LDAP server!
