The sample explains the flow of attributes from an LDAP to an AD resource with some attribute manipulation in between. 

Both resources are simulated by the XML file adapter.

The sync.json contains examples for:

*) mapping of two resources
*) validTarget filter
*) setting "default" values for attributes 
*) "onCreate" actions
*) "onUpdate" actions
*) "correlationQuery" to correlate user with external accounts

Attribute flow:

LDAP ---> OpenIDM ---> AD
