XML connector sample

Please refer to the sample documentation

http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/OpenIDM-Install-Guide.html#chap-sample

Short description:
In this example a very basic reconciliation between OpenIDM and an external XML based resource will be set up. The steps that have to be performed are:

# Configure the OpenIDM internal repository (repo.orient.json)
# Have an example xml file with at least one user ready
# Configure the flow of objects and attributes from the external system into OpenIDM (sync.json)

Alternatively all files from the sample can be copied to a fresh installation. In the openidm folder execute the following to copy all needed files:
cp -r samples/sample1/conf .

The following command will start a one time reconciliation which will create the users from the xml file in the OpenIDM repository of a running server:

$ curl --user openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST -d '{"Hallow":"World"}' "http://localhost:8080/openidm/sync?_action=recon&mapping=systemXmlfileAccounts_managedUser"
