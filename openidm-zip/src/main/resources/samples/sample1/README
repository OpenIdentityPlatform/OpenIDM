The documentation at http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/index.html#chap-sample
describes how to get started with this sample.

The sample shows you reconciliation between the OpenIDM internal
repository and an external XML file, with data flowing from the XML
file into the internal repository.

The sample includes these configuration files also installed in the conf/
directory when you unpack OpenIDM.

*   conf/provisioner.openicf-xml.json shows the XML connector configuration.
*   conf/scheduler-reconcile_systemXmlAccounts_managedUser.json includes a
    scheduler configuration you can use to run reconciliation periodically.
*   conf/sync.json describes how identities in the XML file source map to
    identities in the internal repository target.

Data for this sample is stored in data/xmlConnectorData.xml. The initial
XML file contains a single identity.

$ curl --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" --request POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/sync?_action=recon&mapping=systemXmlfileAccounts_managedUser"

Alternatively, edit conf/scheduler-reconcile_systemXmlAccounts_managedUser.json
to enable scheduled reconciliation:

    "enabled" : true,

The following curl command requests all identifiers in OpenIDM's internal
repository. Use it to see the results after reconciliation for example.

$ curl --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user/?_queryId=query-all-ids"
