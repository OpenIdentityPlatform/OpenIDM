In the usecase folder there are a set of files which together tell a user story based on some common examples.
These files are copied and organized in an appropriate folder structure,
each usecase folder contains the files that are needed for that certain use case sample.

All the samples assume a certain initial setup of managed users in OpenIDM.
The users are organized the following way:
- there are 20 ordinary users: user.0 ... user.19 where 

    - user.0 .. user.4 belong to Human Resources having user.0 as Manager,
       user.0 .. user.3 employees and user.4 contractor

    - user.5 .. user.9 belong to Production Planning having user.5 as Manager,
       user.5 .. user.8 employees and user.9 contractor

    - user.10 .. user.14 belong to Sales & Distribution having user.10 as Manager,
       user.10 .. user.13 employees and user.14 contractor

    - user.15 .. user.19 belong to Treasury & Payments having user.15 as Manager,
       user.15 .. user.18 employees and user.19 contractor

Furthermore we have the following special users:
- hradmin: user representing the human interaction of the HR department
- systemadmin: user representing the human interaction of the populated systems (“Business” and “Project”)
- superadmin: user representing the manager of the managers

The samples use OrientDB as a backend by default. There are other repository configuration files
provided in the samples/usecase/db folder. If you want to use one of the alternative repositories
remove the repo.orientdb.json file from the conf folder of the usecase you want to test (e.g. samples/usecase/usecase1/conf)
and then copy the appropriate repo.jdbc.json to the same folder.
For more information on how to configure an alternative OpenIDM repository, see http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/#chap-repository

List of use cases

Usecase1 - Initial reconciliation
    In this step we import the users from OpenDJ to OpenIDM using reconciliation.

    To prepare to run the sample, download OpenDJ directory server from
    http://forgerock.org/opendj.html. Install OpenDJ using QuickSetup:

        * Use "password" as the password for cn=Directory Manager.
        * Import samples/usecase/data/hr_data.ldif during installation.

    1. Start OpenIDM with the configuration for usecase1.

    $ cd /path/to/openidm
    $ ./startup.sh -p samples/usecase/usecase1

    2. Run reconciliation.

    $ curl -k -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://localhost:8443/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemHRAccounts_managedUser"

    3. Query the managed users created by reconciliation

    $ curl -k -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin "https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_queryId=query-all-ids"
    
    There should be 23 users created. The default password of the imported users is "Passw0rd".

Usecase 2 - New user onboarding
    In this step we simulate an HR employee starting the onboarding process for an employee
    and approval step of the manager.

    If we want to use email notifications as part of the process make the following changes:
    - External email service of OpenIDM has to be configured using the following file:
        samples/usecase/usecase2/conf/external.email.json
        Update the smtp settings in this file before starting the workflow.
    - Change the notification email properties in the workflow definition file.
      To do so:
      - Copy the workflow bar file (samples/usecase/usecase2/workflow/newUserCreate.bar)
        to a temporary location.
      - Unzip the temporary workflow bar file and edit the extracted workflow
        definition (newUserCreate.bpmn20.xml).

        Original:
        emailParams = [from : 'usecasetest@forgerock.com', to : 'notification@example.com', 
                    subject : 'Use Case Test Notification', type : 'text/plain', 
                    body : 'The requested user ' + userName + ' was successfully created']

        Change the from and to fields to contain valid email addresses.

      - When you have completed the edit, zip up the workflow definition file,
        along with the two xhtml templates required for the sample, using a
        command similar to the following:

        $ zip newUserCreate.bar newUserCreate.bpmn20.xml nUCDecideApprovalForm.xhtml nUCStartForm.xhtml

      - Copy the resulting bar file to the workflow directory, overwriting
        the existing bar file:

        $ cp /tmp/newUserCreate.bar  /path/to/openidm/samples/usecase/usecase2/workflow

    
    1. Start OpenIDM with the configuration for usecase2.

        $ cd /path/to/openidm
        $ ./startup.sh -p samples/usecase/usecase2

    2. Log in to the UI as user.1 (this user belongs to HR department, default password is 'Passw0rd')

    3. Select the User Onboarding Process by clicking on it.

    4. Fill the fields of the form presented by the UI. The fields marked with x are mandatory.
        - Department field:
            By selecting one of the four departments we define which department the new user
            will belong to. Based on this the workflow will select the possible candidate assignees
            for the manager approval user task: it will be either superadmin (as manager of everyone)
            or the manager of the selected department (see description above).
            example: if HR is selected the manager candidates will be user.0 and superadmin.
        - User Type field:
            if the User Type field is Employee then the user will have access to an account called "Business".
                This is represented on the managed user in OpenIDM repository by having the following attribute on
                the managed user:
                    accounts : [ "Business"]
            if the User Type is Contractor then the new user won't have any accounts associated to it in
                managed user representation in OpenIDM.

        - Send Email Notification field:
            If 'No' is selected for this field then no email notifications will be sent.
            Notifications will be added to the OpenIDM repository which will appear on UI.

    5. Start the workflow by clicking on Start button.

    6. Log out and log in as the manager of the department selected in the initial start form
        example: if HR was selected then log in as user.0

    7. Click on the Onboarding approval task appearing on UI as task in the group queue
        and assign the user task to user.0 (select 'Assign it to me'). The task appears now in 'My tasks'.

    8. Click on the Task and then on the 'Details' button.
        - Start Date field:
            filling this field results in the user being created and adding the startDate property
            to the user. Furthermore, the user status will be 'inactive'.
            The field is optional, it will be used by TaskScanner to trigger sunrise workflow.
        - End Date field:
            filling this field results in the user being created and adding the startDate property
            to the user.
            The field is optional, it will be used by TaskScanner to trigger sunset workflow.
        - Manager field:
            Selecting yes will add 'title' field to the new managed user with the value 'manager'.
        - Decision field:
            Selecting 'Reject' terminates the workflow and sends a notification to the start user
            of the workflow.
       Complete the task by clicking on 'Complete' button.

    9. If 'Accept' was selected then the user is created as a managed user in OpenIDM.
        The password of the new user is "Passw0rd".
        Two OpenIDM notifications are created about this event: one for the start user and one for the
        new user. Those are visible on the UI after login with the appropriate user.

        If email notification was selected then one email is sent to the user configured at the
        beginning of the use case sample.
    
    10. Sunrise workflow
        If the sunrise date of the new user was set then the user was created with inactive account status.
        To trigger sunrise activate the sunrise task scanner (it's inactive by default):
            samples/usecase/usecase2/conf/schedule-taskscan_sunrise.json
            Change: "enabled" : false
            to "enabled" : true
        The scan will run every minute and checks for users having sunrise date before
        current date plus one day.
        Once the scan is triggered it picks the new user, starts the sunrise workflow on it:
            - changes the account status to active
            - adds an OpenIDM notification to the new user (visible when logging in to OpenIDM UI).

    11. Sunset workflow
        If the sunset date of the new user was set then sunset workflow can be triggered
        To trigger sunset activate the sunset task scanner (it's inactive by default):
            samples/usecase/usecase2/conf/schedule-taskscan_sunset.json
            Change: "enabled" : false
            to "enabled" : true
        The scan will run every minute and checks for users having sunset date before
        current date plus one day.
        Once the scan is triggered it picks the new user, starts the sunset workflow on it:
            - a user task is assigned to the manager of the user (e.g. in our sample the assignee is user.0)
            - Log in to OpenIDM UI with user.0 and select the task in 'My tasks'
            - Decision field:
                - Accept termination: the user's account status will be set to inactive and hradmin
                    receives an OpenIDM notification about it.
                - Modify date: the sunset date of the user will be changed and the manager
                    of the user receives an OpenIDM notification about it (user.0 in our sample).

Usecase 3 - User access request
    In this step we simulate a user starting an access request and having 2-level approval for it.

    If we want to use email notifications as part of the process make the following changes:
    - External email service of OpenIDM has to be configured using the following file:
        samples/usecase/usecase3/conf/external.email.json
        Update the smtp settings in this file before starting the workflow.
    - Change the notification email properties in the workflow definition file:
        samples/usecase/usecase3/workflow/accessRequest.bpmn20.xml

        Original:
        emailParams = [from : 'usecasetest@forgerock.com', to : 'notification@example.com', 
                    subject : 'Use Case Test Notification', type : 'text/plain', body : 'The access request was accepted']
        Change the from and to fields to contain valid email addresses.
        Note that there are 2 occurences of the emailParams, change both.
    
    1. Start OpenIDM with the configuration for usecase3.

        $ cd /path/to/openidm
        $ ./startup.sh -p samples/usecase/usecase3

    2. Log in to the UI as user.1 (this user belongs to HR department, default password is 'Passw0rd')

    3. Select the Access Request Process by clicking on it and start the workflow.

    4. A new task appears in 'My tasks', click on it and select 'Details'.
        - Access to Business system field: the value is reflecting the current value in OpenIDM database
        - Access to Project system field: the value is reflecting the current value in OpenIDM database
        - Send Email Notification field:
            If 'No' is selected for this field then no email notifications will be sent.
            Notifications will be added to the OpenIDM repository which will appear on UI.
        - Request field: Cancel terminates the process and does not change anything.
            Accept starts a user task assigned to the manager of the user (user.0 in this sample).

        Click on Complete after selecting the values.

    5. Log out and log in as the manager of the start user (user.0 in this sample)

    6. Click on the User Access Request Approval task appearing on UI as task in the group queue
        and assign the user task to user.0 (select 'Assign it to me'). The task appears now in 'My tasks'.

    7. Click on the task and then on the 'Details' button.
        The two fields showing the required access rights are modifiable by the manager. 
        Complete the task by clicking on 'Complete' button after selecting the Decision.
        The decision can be
        - Reject: the start user (in our sample user.1) receives a notification about the denial. An OpenIDM 
            notification is created about this event which is visible on the UI after log in with the appropriate user.
            If email notification was selected then one email will be sent to the user configured at the
            beginning of the use case sample.
        - Accept:
            Accept starts a user task assigned to systemadmin.

    8. If the manager accepted log out and log in as systemadmin (default password is "Passw0rd").

    9. Click on the User Access Request Approval task appearing on UI in 'My tasks' and then on the 'Details' button.
        The two fields showing the required access rights are modifiable by the systemadmin. 
        Complete the task by clicking on 'Complete' button after selecting the Decision.
        The request can be
        - Reject: the start user (in our sample user.1) receives a notification about the denial. An OpenIDM 
            notification is created about this event which is visible on the UI after log in with the appropriate user.
            If email notification was selected then one email will be sent to the user configured at the
            beginning of the use case sample.
        - Accept: user.1 is updated in managed users table of OpenIDM reflecting the requested changes.
            An OpenIDM notification is created about this event which is visible on the UI after login with the appropriate user.
            If email notification was selected then one email will be sent to the user configured at the
            beginning of the use case sample.

    In this sample there is an escalation step attached to the manager approval task. If the manager does not complete
    the user task within 10 minutes then a new user task is created and assigned to superadmin. It has the same user interface
    as the one assigned to the manager of the user and has the same functionalities. If the superadmin 
    completes this task then the execution is passed to the administrator approval (systemadmin).

Usecase 4 - Orphan account detection and manual linking task started from reconciliation
    In this use case we show two different asynchronous tasks started from reconciliation:
    detecting orphan accounts on the target objects set and handling ambiguous results of correlation phase.

    1. Before starting the test we need to rename the following file:
    rename samples/usecase/usecase4/conf/syncManagedBusiness.json to samples/usecase/usecase4/conf/sync.json

    In that file we have a mapping defined: recon_managedUser_systemBusiness.
    This mapping has managed users as source and a csv file as target object set. The target object set 
    is defined in samples/usecase/usecase4/data/business.csv file.
    In that file we have all the users of the initial reconciliation (usecase1) which are employees
    and therefore have "Business" in the 'accounts' attribute (see usecase2 User Type).
    Since this mapping has a 'validSource' field defined only those managed users will be taken into
    account which are employees.

    There are some extra users in that csv file:
    - user.50 is defined only in the csv file so when running the reconciliation this user will be 
        detected as an orphan account (orphan account workflow is triggered when the situation is
        "UNQUALIFIED" or "UNASSIGNED").

    - user.33: the 'userName' attribute of this user is 'user.3', same as for user.3.
        When running the correlation query during reconciliation there will be two candidate users
        to be linked with user.3 from managed users (correlation query is based on userName attribute).   
    
    2. Start OpenIDM with the configuration for usecase4.

    $ cd /path/to/openidm
    $ ./startup.sh -p samples/usecase/usecase4

    3. Run reconciliation.

    $ curl -k -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://localhost:8443/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=recon_managedUser_systemBusiness"

    Two asynchronous workflows are started: an orphanAccountReport for user.50 and a
    manualMatch for user.3 of managed users.

    4. Log in to the UI as systemadmin (default password is 'Passw0rd').

    5. Click on the 'Details' button of the 'Manual Linking' task.
        The 'Possible targets' field is modifiable by systemadmin and it is required.
        The decision can be
        - Ignore: no action will be taken (no link will be created) and the workflow terminates.
        - user.3 (user.3 - Atrc, Aaron) or user.3 (user.33 - Atrc, Aaron): these are the two candidate
            users found in the target object set by executing the correlation query. These values 
            are queried in the workflow and the possible values of that field are determined
            at runtime. Here we can choose the user we need.
            After choosing one of the users the workflow will link user.3 of managed user to the selected user 
            of the target object set.

    6. Click on the 'Details' button of the 'Orphan Account' task.
        'Link to' and 'Decision' fields are modifiable by systemadmin.
        Complete the task by clicking on 'Complete' button after selecting the Decision.
        The decision can be
        - Delete: the user will be deleted from the target object set and the workflow terminates.
        - Link: when choosing this option valid managed user id needs to be entered to link the orphan account to.
            Pick any user id from managed users where the managed user is not linked to any users in the csv file yet:
            if this use case is started after the initial reconciliation then pick e.g. user.5.
            If users are created e.g. by using sample2 that user can be used here as well.

Usecase5 - Certification workflows
    In this use case we have two scheduled tasks starting certification workflows.
    
    One of them fetches all the managed users and starts a certification workflow
    for every user. This workflow shows the roles assigned to the managed users.
    The other scheduled task fetches all the managed roles and starts a certification
    workflow for every role. This workflow shows the assignments of the managed
    roles.

    There are four roles defined for this sample based on the departments.
    Each user has a dynamic role by default: the role corresponding to the
    department to which the user belongs.

    1. Start OpenIDM with the configuration for usecase5.

    $ cd /path/to/openidm
    $ ./startup.sh -p samples/usecase/usecase5

    2. Add the following four roles to OpenIDM by running these curl commands:
        $ curl \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "If-None-Match: *" \
        --request PUT \
        --data '{"properties":{"description":"Role for Human Resources department"},
           "assignments":{"ad1":{"attributes":[{"value":
           ["CN=cisco_vpn,DC=example,DC=com"],
           "assignmentOperation": "mergeWithTarget","unassignmentOperation": "removeFromTarget","name": "memberOf"}]}},"name": "Human Resources"}' \
        "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/role/human-resources"

        $ curl \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "If-None-Match: *" \
        --request PUT \
        --data '{"properties":{"description":"Role for Production Planning department"},
           "assignments":{"ad1":{"attributes":[{"value":
           ["CN=intranet,DC=example,DC=com","CN=email,DC=example,DC=com","CN=radius_dialin,DC=example,DC=com"],
           "assignmentOperation": "mergeWithTarget","unassignmentOperation": "removeFromTarget","name": "memberOf"}]}},"name": "Production Planning"}' \
        "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/role/production-planning"

        $ curl \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "If-None-Match: *" \
        --request PUT \
        --data '{"properties":{"description":"Role for Sales and Distribution department"},
           "assignments":{"ad1":{"attributes":[{"value":
           ["CN=intranet,DC=example,DC=com","CN=email,DC=example,DC=com"],
           "assignmentOperation": "mergeWithTarget","unassignmentOperation": "removeFromTarget","name": "memberOf"}]}},"name": "Sales and Distribution"}' \
        "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/role/sales-distribution"

        $ curl \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
        --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "If-None-Match: *" \
        --request PUT \
        --data '{"properties":{"description":"Role for Treasury and Payments department"},
           "assignments":{"ad1":{"attributes":[{"value":
           ["CN=intranet,DC=example,DC=com"],
           "assignmentOperation": "mergeWithTarget","unassignmentOperation": "removeFromTarget","name": "memberOf"}]}},"name": "Treasury and Payments"}' \
        "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/role/treasury-payments"

    3. The scheduled user certification can be triggered by enabling the scheduled task in the 
        samples/usecase/usecase5/conf/schedule-certification.json file.

    4. Log in to the UI as user.0 (default password is 'Passw0rd').

    5. Click on the Role Status Check process task under 'Tasks that are in my
       group's queue'. A scheduled task has been started for each managed user.
       With the default schedule, a new task will be started for each managed
       user every minute. Choose one of the users, for example, user.1, and
       select 'Assign to me' under the Actions column. The task now appears
       under 'My tasks'.

    6. Click on the 'Details' button of the 'Role Status Check' task.
        On the UI a list of available roles defined in OpenIDM is visible:
        - The values of the first column show if the role is currently assigned to the managed user.
        - The values of the second column show if the role will be assigned to the managed user once the certification process is completed.
            If the role is dynamic  (assigned to the user based on the department the user belongs to)
            then the value is readonly.

    7. Complete the task by clicking on 'Complete' button after selecting the appropriate roles
        by choosing one of the following options:
        - Change: the user will be updated based on the values of the second column.
        - Certify: the user will not be updated.
        - Escalate: the manager can't decide so the certification task will be assigned to superadmin.
            In this case log out and log in as superadmin. The user task assigned to superadmin has the same
            elements as the one described here (apart of the 'Escalate' option).

    8. The scheduled role certification can be triggered by enabling the scheduled
       task in the samples/usecase/usecase5/conf/schedule-certificationEntitlements.json
       file.

    9. Log in to the UI as systemadmin (default password is 'Passw0rd').

    10. Click on the 'Details' button of one of the Entitlements Status Check tasks.
        The name, id and description of the role is shown on the UI.
        Below that the assignment and the attribute belonging to the role are shown as a table.
        Here the 'Value' field is editable: after clicking on the text new lines can be added and deleted
        by pushing 'Enter' while typing. Note that this attribute in OpenIDM is multivalued, so
        the separation of the values in this list is done based on the new lines of this UI field.

    11. Once the 'Value' field contains the required values click on 'Complete' 
        after choosing one of the following options:
        - Certify: the role will not be updated
        - Update: the role will be updated by using the new 'Value'

Usecase6 - Password change reminder
    In this use case we use TaskScanner to trigger a password change reminder workflow.
    Every managed user created in OpenIDM has a dedicated attribute to store the date of the last password change event (lastPasswordSet).
    This value is updated by an onStore script defined in managed.json which
    sets the date of this attribute if a new password is stored for the user. The TaskScanner
    scans that attribute and starts a workflow if the password was changed more than an hour ago.

    The workflow is started by passwordchange.js javascript. There are two options to run this workflow:
    - By default it sends the default OpenIDM notifications to the user (visible on the UI).

    - It can send email notification to the user if configured. 
        - External email service of OpenIDM has to be configured using the following file:
            samples/usecase/usecase6/conf/external.email.json
            Update the smtp settings in this file before starting the workflow.
            Note that if you want to use this option you have to make sure that the 'mail' attribute of the
            managed user(s) used for this test case are valid email addresses.

        To enable email notifications change the following parameter of passwordchange.js:
        change "emailEnabled" : "false", 
        to "emailEnabled" : "true",

    The workflow does the following:
    - sends a notification to the user 
    - five minutes later sends an other notification to the user (if password was not changed yet)
    - two minutes later changes the user's 'accountStatus' to 'inactive' and sends notification to the user (if password was not changed yet)

    1. Start OpenIDM with the configuration for usecase6.

    $ cd /path/to/openidm
    $ ./startup.sh -p samples/usecase/usecase6

    2. Activate the password change task scanner (it's inactive by default):
            samples/usecase/usecase6/conf/schedule-taskscan_passwordchange.json
            Change: "enabled" : false
            to "enabled" : true

    3. Log in to the UI as one of the sample users, e.g. user.0 (default password is 'Passw0rd').
        Once the task scanner was triggered a notification is visible for the user on the OpenIDM UI.

    4. To test the workflow the user can change the password either on the UI or using the following REST call:
        curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user/user.0?_action=patch" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  --data '[{"operation":"replace", "field":"/password", "value":"newPassw0rd"}]'
