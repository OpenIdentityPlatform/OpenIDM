The sample shows you reconciliation between the OpenIDM internal repository
and a local LDAP directory server, such as OpenDJ, with data flowing from
OpenDJ into the internal repository. No changes are pushed from OpenIDM
to OpenDJ.

The following documentation shows how to get started with this sample:
http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/index.html#more-sample2

The sample includes these configuration files.

*   conf/provisioner.openicf-ldap.json configures the LDAP connector.
    By default, the LDAP connector uses the following parameters:
    "host" : "localhost",
    "port" : 1389,
    "principal" : "cn=Directory Manager",
    "credentials" : "password",
    "baseContextsToSynchronize" : [ "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" ],
    "attributesToSynchronize" : [ "uid", "sn", "cn", "givenName", "mail", "description" ],
*   conf/scheduler-recon.json configures a scheduler you can use to run
    reconciliation periodically.
*   conf/sync.json describes how identities in the directory server map to
    identities in the internal repository target.

Data for this sample is stored in data/Example.ldif. After you import
the data, ou=People,dc=example,dc=com contains a single user entry for
the user from the first sample. Although all attributes to synchronize 
can be multi-valued in LDAP, this sample defines only mail as a multi-
valued attribute in OpenIDM, in order to match the definition in the
first sample.

The following curl command runs reconciliation once, creating users defined
in OpenDJ in OpenIDM's internal repository:

$ curl --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" --request POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/sync?_action=recon&mapping=systemLdapAccounts_managedUser"

Alternatively, edit conf/scheduler-recon.json to enable scheduled
reconciliation:

    "enabled" : true,

The following curl command requests all identifiers in OpenIDM's internal
repository. Use it to see the results after reconciliation for example.

$ curl --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user/?_queryId=query-all-ids"
