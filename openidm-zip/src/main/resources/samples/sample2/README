The sample configuration connects to a local OpenDJ with the following paramers:

"host" : "localhost",
"port" : 4389,
"principal" : "cn=Directory Manager",
"credentials" : "password",

The sync configuration contains only one mapping from OpenDJ to OpenIDM and a limited number of attributes. 
It contains a scheduler configuration which can be used to schedule reconciliation.
New users will be created from LDAP or existing will be updated.
No changes will be pushed from OpenIDM into the LDAP server!
