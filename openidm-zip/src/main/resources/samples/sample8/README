XML connector sample to demo logging in scripts and the situation dependent content of the source object

Please refer to the sample documentation

http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/OpenIDM-Install-Guide.html#chap-sample


Short description:
In this example a basic reconciliation between OpenIDM and an external XML based resource will be set up. The steps that have to be performed are:

$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ cp -r samples/sample8/conf .
$ cp -r samples/sample8/script .


The following command will start a one time reconciliation which will create the users from the xml file in the OpenIDM repository of a running server:

curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/sync?_action=recon&mapping=systemXmlfileAccounts_managedUser"

Hint: the log level in the demo scripts is set to "warn" to make OpenIDM show the messages on the Felix console with the default console logging configuration.
