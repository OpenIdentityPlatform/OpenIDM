This sample is the same as sample 2c except that it focuses on synchronizing 
LDAP groups.

To run this sample, launch OpenIDM with the sample configuration as follows:
$ /path/to/openidm/startup.sh -p samples/sample2d

or follow the documentation in the Install Guide:
http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/install-guide/index.html#more-sample2d
 
The sample configuration connects to a local OpenDJ server with the following 
parameters:

"host" : "localhost",
"port" : 1389,
"principal" : "cn=Directory Manager",
"credentials" : "password",

Unlike sample2, this sample sync.json configuration contains three mappings - 
two for user objects and one for group objects. The number of attributes mapped 
is limited.

New groups are created from LDAP by running a reconciliation against the LDAP 
groups. Reconciliation synchronizes the cn and dn of the groups as well as the 
description and the uniqueMember attribute which contains a list of all the 
member DNs of this group.
