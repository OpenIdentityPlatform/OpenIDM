The sample is the same as sample 2c except that it focuses on syncing  ldapGroups.
 
The sample configuration connects to a local OpenDJ with the following paramers:

"host" : "localhost",
"port" : 1389,
"principal" : "cn=Directory Manager",
"credentials" : "password",

In opposite to sample2, this sample sync.json configuration contains three mappings:two for user objects and one for group objects. 
The number of attributes mapped are still rather limited.

New groups will be created from LDAP by running a reconciliation against the ldap groups.

Ti will sync cn and dn of the groups as well as the description and the uniqueMember attribute which contains a list of all of this group's member's dns.

For a more precise description on how to run the sample see:
