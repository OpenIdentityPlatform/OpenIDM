This sample demonstrates how perform an asynchronous action from a reconciliation.

To try the sample, follow these steps.

    1. Copy the sample configuration and data.

    $ cd /path/to/openidm
    $ cp -r samples/sample9/conf samples/sample9/workflow.

    2. Start OpenIDM.

    $ ./startup.sh

    3. Run reconciliation.

    $ curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemXmlfileAccounts_managedUser"

    4. The reconciliation starts an approval workflow for each ABSENT user.
       These workflows (managedUserApproval) wait for approval.

    5. Query the started workflow task instances.

    $curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin "http://localhost:8080/openidm/workflow/taskinstance?_queryId=query-all-ids"

        sample response:
        {"result":[{"_id":"26","name":"Evaluate request"},{"_id":"16","name":"Evaluate request"}]}

    6. Approve the requests.
   
    $curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/workflow/taskinstance/16?_action=complete" --data '{"requestApproved": "true"}'
    $curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/workflow/taskinstance/26?_action=complete" --data '{"requestApproved": "true"}'

    7. Query the managed users created by the async reconciliation after the approval step.

    $curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user?_queryId=query-all-ids"

The sample is also availeble with the -p samples/sample9 option now. 

For testing the sample you might want to copy the following into a an exacutable text file and run it:

echo "copy the workflow and wait for 3 seconds to deploy"
cp openidm/samples/sample9/workflow/managedUserApproval.bar openidm/workflow/
sleep 3
echo "run recon and then wait for 3 sec to get the instance id"
curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemXmlfileAccounts_managedUser"
sleep 3
curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin "http://localhost:8080/openidm/workflow/taskinstance?_queryId=query-all-ids"
echo ""
echo "now run the following after replacing XX with the taskinstanceNumber (the _id property) from above!"
echo 'curl -u openidm-admin:openidm-admin -X POST "http://localhost:8080/openidm/workflow/taskinstance/XX?_action=complete" --data '\''{"requestApproved": "true"}'\'
