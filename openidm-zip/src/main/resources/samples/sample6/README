The sample configuration connects to two local OpenDJ with the following paramers:

In the sample config both provisioners point to the same ldap server but on different baseContexts!
To change the example and use two independent ldap processes they need to listen to different ports and the provisioner configurations need to be changed accordingly.

"host" : "localhost",
"port" : 4389,
"principal" : "cn=Directory Manager",
"credentials" : "password",
"baseContexts" : "ou=people,o=ad" -> AD (is represented by an OpenDJ)
"baseContexts" : "ou=people,o=aaa" -> LDAP (is represented by an OpenDJ)

The example configuration will pick up new and changed users from LDAP (i.e. ou=people,o=aaa) and send the updates to AD. For simplicity no flow from AD to LDAP is configured!
