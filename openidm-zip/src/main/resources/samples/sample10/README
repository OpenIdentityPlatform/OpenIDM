The sample demonstrates how to populate the security context when using IWA as an authentication mechanism.

The configuration files used in this sample are as follows:

*   samples/sample10/conf/authentication.json details the authentication chain used to authenticate users.
*   samples/sample10/script/authnPopulateContext.js performs the population of the security context.

Change the following attributes in the samples/sample10/conf/authentication.json to match your Kerberos set up:
*   servicePrincipal
*   keytabFileName
*   kerberosRealm
*   kerberosServerName

To run the sample, start OpenIDM with the configuration for sample 10

$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/sample10

In browser configured and set up for IWA, navigate to http://localhost:8080/openidm and if IWA is set up correctly
you should automatically be logged in.
