Scripted SQL sample using mySQL

Before the example can be started a mySQL db must be running and available.
There is a script in smaple3/data called sample_HR_DB.mysql which will create a sample db with some sample users. 
It will also grant access to that db for the user "root" with the password "passowrd" (no quotes).

The mysql jdbc driver must be available in the bundle folder too!

For the moment the example's sync and repo json files only support recon against the DB. Pushing changes from openidm to the DB will follow soon.
