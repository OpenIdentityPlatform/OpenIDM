// A configuration for allowed HTTP requests. Each entry in the configuration contains a pattern 
// to match against the incoming request ID and, in the event of a match, the associated roles, 
// methods, and actions that are allowed for requests on that particular pattern.
//
// pattern:  A pattern to match against an incoming request's resource ID
// roles:  A comma separated list of allowed roles
// methods:  A comma separated list of allowed methods
// actions:  A comma separated list of allowed actions
// customAuthz: A custom function for additional authorization logic/checks (optional)
// excludePatterns: A comma separated list of patterns to exclude from the pattern match (optional)
//
// A single '*' character indicates all possible values.  With patterns ending in "/*", the "*"
// acts as a wild card to indicate the pattern accepts all resource IDs "below" the specified
// pattern (prefix).  For example the pattern "managed/*" would match "managed/user" or anything
// starting with "managed/".  Note: it would not match "managed", which would need to have its 
// own entry in the config.
