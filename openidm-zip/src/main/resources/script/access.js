/**
 * A configuration for allowed HTTP requests. Each entry in the configuration contains a pattern 
 * to match against the incoming request ID and, in the event of a match, the associated roles, 
 * methods, and actions that are allowed for requests on that particular pattern.
 *
 * pattern:  A pattern to match against an incoming request's resource ID
 * roles:  A comma separated list of allowed roles
 * methods:  A comma separated list of allowed methods
 * actions:  A comma separated list of allowed actions
 * customAuthz: A custom function for additional authorization logic/checks (optional)
 * excludePatterns: A comma separated list of patterns to exclude from the pattern match (optional)
 *
 * A single '*' character indicates all possible values.  With patterns ending in "/*", the "*"
 * acts as a wild card to indicate the pattern accepts all resource IDs "below" the specified
 * pattern (prefix).  For example the pattern "managed/*" would match "managed/user" or anything
 * starting with "managed/".  Note: it would not match "managed", which would need to have its 
 * own entry in the config.
