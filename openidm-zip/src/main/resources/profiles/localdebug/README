Development profile

Localdebug profile which allows to modify workspace configuration files and scripts without need of rebuilding openidm-zip.
It creates symlinks to the conf and script folders in home directory. If home directory conf and script folders are in fact symlinks pointing to
your workspace folders, you can easily manipulate workspace configuration and see results without recompiling the project.
