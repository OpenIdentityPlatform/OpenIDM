    Implements an action request which will augment the currently-running user
    with a profile read from an identity provider.

    Expects four "additionalParameters" provided as part of the request:
        code : the authorization code obtained from the authorization endpoint (likely via a browser)
        nonce : the random value saved by the client intended to compare with fetched claim
        redirect_uri: the return endpoint provided by the browser during the authorization request
        provider: the name of the identity provider which is being interacted with

    Returns the modified user account
