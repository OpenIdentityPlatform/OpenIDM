UI Endpoints for Update Process

1. Get list of update archives in openidm/update:

	ACTION openidm/maintenance/update?_action=available

	returns:
    {
        "updates":
            [
                {
                    "archive": "OpenIDM-4.2.0.zip",
                    "fileSize": 80681980,
                    "fileDate": "Wed Feb 24 12:51:05 PST 2016",
                    "checksum": "D754CCCFAF336509D20DA66D6ECC74FB",
                    "fromProduct": "OpenIDM",
                    "fromVersion": [
                        "4.1.0"
                    ],
                    "toProduct": "OpenIDM",
                    "toVersion": "4.2.0",
                    "description": "Full product installation",
                    "resource": "http://openidm.forgerock.org/doc/bootstrap/integrators-guide/",
                    "restartRequired": true
                }, {
                    ...
                }
	        ],
        "rejects":
            [
                {
                  "archive": "update.xyz",
                  "reason": "File does not have '.zip' extension."
                },
                {
                  "archive": "update.zip",
                  "reason": "The archive update.zip can be used only to upgrade version '8.8.8' and you are running
                  version 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
                },
                {
                  "archive": "update_bad.zip",
                  "reason": "Unable to read or find package.properties within update_bad.zip",
                  "errorMessage": "Possible exception message."
                },
                {
                  "archive": "update_XXX.zip",
                  "reason": "The archive update_XXX.zip can be used only to upgrade product 'OpenXXX' and you are
                  running product OpenIDM"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

2. Get list of file changes for a given update archive:

	ACTION openidm/maintenance/update?_action=preview&archive=OpenIDM-4.5.0.zip

	returns:
	[
		{
			"filePath" : "bin/defaults/script/access.js",
			"fileState" : "UNEXPECTED" (states from FileState.java, see below)
		}, {
			...
		}
	]

2b. Get applicable license for an update archive:

	ACTION openidm/maintenance/update?_action=getLicense&archive=OpenIDM-4.5.0.zip

	returns:
    {
        "license" : "<WALL O' TEXT>"
    }

3. Perform update using a given update archive

	ACTION openidm/maintenance/update?_action=update&archive=OpenIDM-4.5.0.zip

	returns:
	{
		"_id" : "someIDstring",
		"status" : "IN_PROGRESS" (see below for possible states),
		"statusMessage" : "Initializing",
		"completedTasks" : 0,
		"totalTasks" : 350,
		"startDate" : "2016-04-01 12:00:00",
		"user" : "openidm-admin"
	}

4. Get status of running update

	QUERY openidm/maintenance/update/log?_queryFilter=_id+eq+%22someIDstring%22

	returns (while still in progress):
	{
		"_id" : "someIDstring",
		"status" : "IN_PROGRESS",
		"statusMessage" : "Doing something",
		"completedTasks" : 150,
		"totalTasks" : 350,
		"startDate" : "2016-04-01 12:00:00",
		"user" : "openidm-admin"
	}

	(while in terminal state):
	{
		"_id" : "someIDstring",
		"status" : "COMPLETE" | "REVERTED",
		"statusMessage" : "Something went horribly wrong",
		"completedTasks" : 15,
		"totalTasks" : 350,
		"startDate" : "2016-04-01 12:00:00",
		"endDate" : "2016-04-01 13:00:00",
		"user" : "openidm-admin",
		"nodeId" : "node3",
		"files" : [
			{
				"filePath" : "bin/defaults/script/access.js",
				"fileState" : "REPLACED" (see Post-Update File States below),
				"backup" : "bin/defaults/script/access.js.<update id>"
			},
			...
		]
	}

	Note that if the final status was unsuccessful and the update was reverted the "backup" attribute will not be
	present (backups have been removed as part of the revert).

5. Get list of updates

	QUERY openidm/maintenance/update/log/?_queryFilter=true

	returns:
	[
		{
			"archive" : "OpenIDM-4.1.0.zip",
			"_id" : "someIDstring",
			"status" : "COMPLETED",
    		"statusMessage" : "Rainbows and unicorns",
    		"completedTasks" : 350,
	    	"totalTasks" : 350,
    		"startDate" : "2016-04-01 12:00:00",
    		"endDate" : "2016-04-01 13:00:00",
    		"user" : "openidm-admin",
    		"nodeId" : "node1"
		},
		...
	]

	The id can be passed to READ openidm/maintenance/update/log/someIDstring to fetch the log if terminal or just status
	otherwise.

6. Optionally restart IDM immediately.  IDM can be restarted at any time with this call.  If an update has completed
    and is sleeping prior to the automatic restart this method call will interrupt that sleep to restart immediately.

    POST openidm/maintenance/update?_action=restart

    returns:
    {}

7. Return the id of the most recently successfully installed update

    POST openidm/maintenance/update?_action=lastUpdateId

    returns:
    {
        "lastUpdateId" : "<value>"
    }



FileState States:

    These states are described from the perspective of the existing installation, not that of the update archive.

    /** The file exists on disk but not in the list of known files for the original distribution. */
    UNEXPECTED,
    /** The file does not exist on disk nor in the list of known files for the original distribution. */
    NONEXISTENT,
    /** The file should exist but does not. */
    DELETED,
    /** The file on disk has been changed since the original deployment in a read-only directory. */
    DIFFERS,
    /** The file is unchanged from the original distribution. */
    UNCHANGED

Update Stati:

    IN_PROGRESS     Update has started but not yet completed
    COMPLETE        Update has completed
    FAILED          Update failed but has not yet reverted
    REVERTED        Update failed and was reverted

    Note that it is possible an update could remain in IN_PROGRESS or FAILED state forever if the thread/process
    died before the update could reach COMPLETE or REVERTED, the two "terminal states".  Updates are not reentrant
    at this time.

Post-Update File States:

    REPLACED        Original file was replaced with new file. If original file had user changes it was renamed with
                    a -old extension.
    PRESERVED       Original file contained user changes and was preserved. New file added with -new extension.
    APPLIED         A patch was applied to the configuration of the same name.



Other

Backups should be named after the original file plus the update id as a suffix. Thus script/access.js backed up as
part of an update assign the id "123foo" named script/access.js.123foo.

Requests for update history against repo/update can use queryFilter to filter the history results.
