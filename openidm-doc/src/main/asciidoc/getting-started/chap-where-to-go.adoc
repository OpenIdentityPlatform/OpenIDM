[#chap-where-to-go]
== Where To Go From Here

OpenIDM can do much more than reconcile data between two different sources. In this chapter, you will read about the key features of OpenIDM, with links to additional information about each feature.

[#gsg-bpmn]
=== Integrating Business Processes and Workflows

A business process begins with an objective and includes a well-defined sequence of tasks to meet that objective. In OpenIDM, you can configure many of these tasks as self-service workflows, such as self-registration, new user onboarding, and account certification.

With OpenIDM, you can automate many of these tasks as a workflow.

Once you configure the right workflows, a newly hired engineer can log into OpenIDM and request access to manufacturing information.

That request is sent to the appropriate manager for approval. Once approved, the OpenIDM provisions the new engineer with access to manufacturing.

OpenIDM supports workflow-driven provisioning activities, based on the embedded link:http://activiti.org[Activiti, window=\_blank] Process Engine, which complies with the link:http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/[Business Process Model and Notation 2.0, window=\_blank] (BPMN 2.0) standard.

OpenIDM integrates additional workflows such as new user onboarding, orphan account detection, and password change reminders. For more information, see xref:../samples-guide/chap-workflow-samples.adoc#chap-workflow-samples["Workflow Samples"] in the __Samples Guide__.


[#gsg-passwords]
=== Managing Passwords

You can manage passwords from the Self-Service User Interface, also known as the Self-Service UI. From the Admin UI, click on the icon in the upper-right corner. In the menu that appears, click Self-Service:

[#d7821e651]
image::images/gsg-selfservice-menu.png[]
You should now be in the Self-Service UI. Click Profile > Password. You can now change your password, subject to the policy limits shown.

[#d7821e664]
image::images/gsg-password.png[]
As you can see, OpenIDM supports a robust password policy. You can modify the rules shown, or add more rules such as the following:

* Elements that should not be a part of a password, such as a family name

* Password expiration dates

* Password histories, to prevent password reuse

For more information, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-passwords.adoc#chap-passwords["Managing Passwords"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.


[#gsg-role-management]
=== Managing User Roles

Some users need accounts on multiple systems. For example, insurance agents may also have insurance policies with the company that they work for. In that situation, the insurance agent is also a customer of the company.

Alternatively, a salesperson may also test customer engineering scenarios. That salesperson may also need access to engineering systems.

In OpenIDM, each of these user scenarios is known as a __role__. OpenIDM allows you to set up a consolidated set of attributes associated with each role. To do so, you would configure custom roles to assign to selected users. For example, you may assign both __insured__ and __agent__ roles to an agent, while assigning the __insured__ role to all customers.

In a similar fashion, OpenIDM allows you to assign both __sales__ and __engineering__ roles to the sales engineer.

You can then synchronize users with those roles into appropriate data stores.

For more information, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-users-groups-roles.adoc#working-with-managed-roles["Working With Managed Roles"] in the __Integrator's Guide__. For a sample of how you can configure external roles within OpenIDM, see xref:../samples-guide/chap-roles-sample.adoc#chap-roles-sample["Roles Samples - Demonstrating the OpenIDM Roles Implementation"] in the __Samples Guide__.


[#gsg-connectors]
=== Connecting to Remote Data Stores

You can use OpenIDM to connect to a substantial variety of user and device data stores, on premise and in the cloud. While OpenIDM can connect to some connectors dedicated to a few data stores, OpenIDM can also connect to many more data stores using a scripted connector framework.
OpenIDM includes support for connectors to the following external resources:

* Google Web Applications (see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-google.adoc#chap-google["Google Apps Connector"] in the __Connectors Guide__).

* Salesforce (see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-salesforce.adoc#chap-salesforce["Salesforce Connector"] in the __Connectors Guide__).

* Any LDAPv3-compliant directory, including link:../../../opendj/3.5/install-guide[OpenDJ, window=\_blank] and Active Directory (see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-ldap.adoc#chap-ldap["Generic LDAP Connector"] in the __Connectors Guide__).

* CSV Files (see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-csv.adoc#chap-csv["CSV File Connector"] in the __Connectors Guide__).

* Database Tables (see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-database.adoc#chap-database["Database Table Connector"] in the __Connectors Guide__).

If the resource that you need is not on the list, you should be able to use one of the OpenIDM scripted connector frameworks to connect to that resource:

* For connectors associated with Microsoft Windows, OpenIDM includes a PowerShell Connector Toolkit that you can use to provision a variety of Microsoft services, including but not limited to Active Directory, SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, Azure Active Directory, and Office 365. For more information, see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-powershell.adoc#chap-powershell["PowerShell Connector Toolkit"] in the __Connectors Guide__. OpenIDM includes a sample PowerShell Connector Toolkit configuration, described in xref:../samples-guide/chap-powershell-samples.adoc#chap-powershell-samples["Samples That Use the PowerShell Connector Toolkit to Create Scripted Connectors"] in the __Samples Guide__.

* For other external resources, OpenIDM includes a Groovy Connector Toolkit that allows you to run Groovy scripts to interact with any external resource. For more information, see xref:../connectors-guide/chap-groovy.adoc#chap-groovy["Groovy Connector Toolkit"] in the __Connectors Guide__. xref:../samples-guide/chap-groovy-samples.adoc#chap-groovy-samples["Samples That Use the Groovy Connector Toolkit to Create Scripted Connectors"] in the __Samples Guide__ includes samples of how you might implement the scripted Groovy connector.



[#gsg-recon]
=== Reconciliation

OpenIDM supports reconciliation between two data stores, as a source and a target.

In identity management, reconciliation compares the contents of objects in different data stores, and makes decisions based on configurable policies.

For example, if you have an application that maintains its own user store, OpenIDM can ensure your canonical directory attributes are kept up to date by reconciling their values as they are changed.

For more information, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#chap-synchronization["Synchronizing Data Between Resources"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.


[#gsg-auth-modules]
=== Authentication Modules Available for OpenIDM

OpenIDM has access to several different authentication modules that can help you protect your systems. For more information, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-auth.adoc#supported-auth-session-modules["Supported Authentication and Session Modules"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.


[#gsg-usecases]
=== Finding Additional Use Cases

OpenIDM is a lightweight and highly customizable identity management product.

The OpenIDM documentation includes additional use cases. Most of them are known as __Samples__, and are described in xref:../samples-guide/chap-overview.adoc#chap-overview["Overview of the OpenIDM Samples"] in the __Samples Guide__.

These samples include step-by-step instructions on how you can connect to different data stores, customize product behavior using JavaScript and Groovy, and administer OpenIDM with Open Identity Platform's commons RESTful API commands.
