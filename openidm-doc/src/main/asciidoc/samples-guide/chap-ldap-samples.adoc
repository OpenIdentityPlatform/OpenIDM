== LDAP Samples - Reconciling Data Between OpenIDM and One or More LDAP Directories

This chapter walks you through the LDAP samples (those samples labeled 2, 2b, 2c, 2d, 5, 5b and 6 in the `openidm/samples` directory). For a complete list of the samples provided with OpenIDM, and an overview of each sample, see xref:chap-overview.adoc#chap-overview["Overview of the OpenIDM Samples"].

[#more-sample-2]
=== Sample 2 - LDAP One Way

Sample 2 resembles xref:chap-xml-samples.adoc#more-sample-1["First OpenIDM Sample - Reconciling an XML File Resource"], but in sample 2 OpenIDM is connected to a local LDAP server. The sample has been tested with link:https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ[OpenDJ, window=\_blank], but should work with any LDAPv3-compliant server.

Sample 2 demonstrates how OpenIDM can pick up new or changed objects from an external resource. The sample contains only one mapping, from the external LDAP server resource to the OpenIDM repository. The sample therefore does not push any changes made to OpenIDM managed user objects out to the LDAP server.

[#external-ldap-config-2]
==== LDAP Server Configuration

Sample 2 expects the following configuration for the external LDAP server:

* The LDAP server runs on the local host.

* The LDAP server listens on port 1389.

* A user with DN `cn=Directory Manager` and password `password` has read access to the LDAP server.

* Directory data for that server is stored under base DN `dc=example,dc=com`.

* User objects for that server are stored under base DN `ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`.

* User objects have the object class `inetOrgPerson`.

* User objects have the following attributes:
+

** `cn`

** `description`

** `givenName`

** `mail`

** `sn`

** `telephoneNumber`

** `uid`

** `userPassword`

+
An example user object follows.
+

The following steps provide setup instructions for an OpenDJ server. Adjust these instructions if you are using an alternative LDAP server.

====

. Download OpenDJ from the link:https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases[GitHub, window=\_top] and extract the zip archive.
+
The LDIF data for this sample is provided in the file `openidm/samples/sample2/data/Example.ldif`. You will need to import this data during your OpenDJ setup.

. Install OpenDJ using the command-line setup.
+
Substitute the `--ldifFile` argument with the path to the `Example.ldif` file in your OpenIDM installation:
+

[source, console]

[#install-sample2]
==== Install the Sample

Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration for sample 2.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/sample2
----


[#run-sample2]
==== Reconcile the Repository

The mapping configuration file (`sync.json`) for this sample includes the mapping `systemLdapAccounts_managedUser`, which synchronize users from the source LDAP server with the target OpenIDM repository.

You can run this part of the sample by using the `curl` command-line utility, or by using the OpenIDM Administration UI. This section provides instructions for both methods.

[#d5830e1489]
.Run the Sample Using the Command Line
====

. Reconcile the repository by running the following command:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request POST \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemLdapAccounts_managedUser&waitForCompletion=true"
{
  "_id": "b1394d10-29b0-4ccf-81d8-c88948ea121c-4",
  "state": "SUCCESS"
}
----
+
The reconciliation operation creates the two users from the LDAP server in the OpenIDM repository, assigning the new objects random unique IDs.

. To retrieve the users from the repository, query their IDs as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user?_queryId=query-all-ids"

[#more-sample-2b]
=== Sample 2b - LDAP Two Way

Like sample 2, sample 2b connects to an external LDAP server. However, sample 2b has two mappings configured, one from the LDAP server to the OpenIDM repository, and the other from the OpenIDM repository to the LDAP server.

[#external-ldap-config-2b]
==== External LDAP Configuration

As demonstrated for sample 2, you can use OpenDJ as an LDAP server. The LDIF data for this sample is provided in the file `openidm/samples/sample2b/data/Example.ldif`. You will need to import this data during your OpenDJ setup.

Configure the LDAP server as for sample 2, xref:#external-ldap-config-2["LDAP Server Configuration"], but import the LDIF file that is specific to Sample 2b during the setup. The LDAP user must have write access to create users from OpenIDM on the LDAP server.


[#install-sample2b]
==== Install the Sample

Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration for sample 2b.

. By default, __implicit synchronization__ is enabled for mappings __from__ the `managed/user` repository __to__ any external resource. This means that when you update a managed object, any mappings defined in the `sync.json` file that have the managed object as the source are automatically executed to update the target system. For more information, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#synchronization-mappings-file["Mapping Source Objects to Target Objects"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

[#more-sample-2c]
=== Sample 2c - Synchronizing LDAP Group Membership

Like sample 2b, sample 2c connects to an external LDAP server and has mappings from the LDAP server to the OpenIDM repository, and from the OpenIDM repository to the LDAP server. However, in sample 2c, LDAP group memberships are synchronized, in addition to user entries.

As demonstrated for sample 2, you can use OpenDJ as an LDAP server. The LDIF data for this sample is provided in the file `openidm/samples/sample2c/data/Example.ldif`.

[#external-ldap-config-2c]
==== External LDAP Configuration

Configure the LDAP server as for sample 2, xref:#external-ldap-config-2["LDAP Server Configuration"]. The LDAP user must have write access to create users from OpenIDM on the LDAP server. When you configure the LDAP server, import the LDIF file customized for this sample, `openidm/samples/sample2c/data/Example.ldif`. This file includes two LDAP groups:

[source, ldif]
----
dn: ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
ou: Groups
objectClass: organizationalUnit
objectClass: top

dn: cn=openidm,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com

objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top
----
The users with DNs `uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com` and `uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com` are also imported with the `Example.ldif` file.

Examine the information stored for user `jdoe`. Click the Linked Systems tab. The Linked Resource item indicates the external resource on which John Doe's managed object is mapped, in this case, `ldap account`.
+
In this linked resource, John Doe's `ldapGroups` are displayed. Currently, John Doe is a member of `cn=openidm,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`.

. Update John Doe's `ldapGroups` property to change his membership from the `openidm` group to the `openidm2` group. Currently, you can only do this over the REST interface, as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \

  "ldapGroups": [
    "cn=openidm2,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"
  ]
}
----
+
This command changes John Doe's `ldapGroups` property in the OpenIDM repository, from `"cn=openidm,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"` to `"cn=openidm2,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"`. As a result of implicit synchronization, the change is propagated to the LDAP server. John Doe is removed from the first LDAP group and added to the second LDAP group in OpenDJ.

. You can verify this change by reloading John Doe's user information, clicking Linked Systems, and examining the value of his `ldapGroups` property.

[#more-sample-2d]
=== Sample 2d - Synchronizing LDAP Groups

Sample 2d also connects to an external LDAP server. This sample focuses on LDAP Group synchronization.

As demonstrated for sample 2, you can use OpenDJ as an LDAP server. Before installing OpenDJ, you may need an LDIF file. The OpenIDM installation includes the following LDIF file, customized for this sample: `openidm/samples/sample2d/data/Example.ldif`. If you need a copy of this file, download and install OpenIDM as described in xref:../install-guide/chap-install.adoc#install-openidm["To Install OpenIDM Services"] in the __Installation Guide__.

[#external-ldap-config-2d]
==== External LDAP Configuration

Configure the LDAP server as for sample 2, xref:#external-ldap-config-2["LDAP Server Configuration"]. The LDAP user must have write access to create users from OpenIDM on the LDAP server.

In addition, two LDAP Groups should be created, as found in the following LDIF file: `openidm/samples/sample2d/data/Example.ldif` (if they have not already been added through sample 2c):

[source, ldif]
----
dn: ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
ou: Groups
objectClass: organizationalUnit
objectClass: top

dn: cn=openidm,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
uniqueMember: uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
cn: openidm
objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top

dn: cn=openidm2,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
uniqueMember: uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
cn: openidm2
objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top
----
The user with dn `uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com` is also imported with the `Example.ldif` file.

There is an additional user, `bjensen` in the sample LDIF file. This user is essentially a "dummy" user, provided for compliance with RFC 4519, which stipulates that every `groupOfUniqueNames` object must contain at least one `uniqueMember`. `bjensen` is not actually used in this sample.


[#install-sample2d]
==== Install the Sample

Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration for sample 2d.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/sample2d
----


[#run-sample2d]
==== Running the Sample

The mapping configuration file (`sync.json`) for this sample includes three mappings:

* `systemLdapAccounts_managedUser`
+
Synchronizes users from the source LDAP server with the target OpenIDM repository,

* `managedUser_systemLdapAccounts`
+
Synchronizes changes from the OpenIDM repository to the LDAP server.

* `systemLdapGroups_managedGroup`
+
Synchronizes groups from the source LDAP server with the target OpenIDM repository.

Due to the similarity with other OpenIDM samples, especially samples 2b and 2c, the focus of this sample is on the mapping unique to this sample, `systemLdapGroups_managedGroup`.

You can run this part of the sample by using the `curl` command-line utility, or by using the OpenIDM Administration UI. This section provides instructions for both methods.

[#d5830e2171]
.Run the Sample Using the Command Line
====

. Reconcile the repository over the REST interface for the group mapping, `systemLdapGroups_managedGroup` by running the following command:
+

[source, console]
----
$  curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request POST \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemLdapGroups_managedGroup&waitForCompletion=true"
----
+
The reconciliation operation returns a reconciliation run ID, and the status of the operation.

. With the configuration of sample 2d, OpenIDM creates group objects from LDAP in OpenIDM. To list group objects by ID, run a query over the REST interface.
+

[source, console]
----
$  curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \

[#more-sample-5]
=== Sample 5 - Synchronization of Two LDAP Resources

Sample 5 demonstrates the flow of data from one external resource to another. The resources are named `LDAP` and `AD` but in the sample, both resources are simulated with XML files.

You can optionally configure an outbound email service, if you want to receive emailed reconciliation summaries, as described in the following section.

[#email-sample5]
==== Configure Email for the Sample

If you do not configure the email service, the functionality of the sample does not change. However, you might see the following message in the OSGi console when you run a reconciliation operation:

[source, console]
----
Email service not configured; report not generated.
----

====
To configure OpenIDM to send a reconciliation summary by email, follow these steps:

. Copy the template `external.email.json` file from the `samples/misc` directory to the `conf` directory of Sample 5:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ cp samples/misc/external.email.json samples/sample5/conf
----

. Edit the `external.email.json` file for outbound email, as described in xref:../integrators-guide/chap-mail.adoc#chap-mail["Sending Email"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

. Edit the `reconStats.js` file from the `sample5/script` directory. Near the start of the file, configure the OpenIDM email service to send statistics to the email addresses of your choice:
+

[source, javascript]
----
var email = {
      //UPDATE THESE VALUES
      from : "openidm@example.com",
      to : "youremail@example.com",
      cc : "idmadmin2@example.com,idmadmin3@example.com",
      subject : "Recon stats for " + global.mappingName,
      type : "text/html"
},
template,
...
----

====


[#install-sample5]
==== Install the Sample

No external configuration is required for this sample. Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration of sample 5.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/sample5
----
The XML files that simulate the resources are located in the `openidm/samples/sample5/data/` folder. When you start OpenIDM with the sample 5 configuration, OpenIDM creates the `xml_AD_Data.xml` file, which does not contain users until you run reconciliation.


[#run-sample5]
==== Run the Sample

Run a reconciliation operation, to synchronize the contents of the simulated LDAP resource to the OpenIDM repository.

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request POST \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemLdapAccounts_managedUser&waitForCompletion=true"
----
This command creates a user in the repository. It is not necessary to run a second reconciliation operation to synchronize the AD resource. Automatic synchronization propagates any change made to managed users in the OpenIDM repository to the simulated AD resource.

Review the contents of `xml_AD_Data.xml`. It should now contain information for the same user that was present in the startup version of the `xml_LDAP_Data.xml` file.

Alternatively, you can list users in the AD resource with the following command:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/system/ad/account?_queryId=query-all-ids"
   
   {
  "result" : [ {
    "name" : "DDOE1",
    "__UID__" : "8dad9df3-820d-41ea-a3ab-a80c241bbc98",
    "_id" : "8dad9df3-820d-41ea-a3ab-a80c241bbc98"
  } ],
...
}
----
You can use the `_id` of the user to read the user information from the AD resource, for example:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/system/ad/account/8dad9df3-820d-41ea-a3ab-a80c241bbc98"
{
  "email" : [ "mail1@example.com" ],
  "name" : "DDOE1",
  "__UID__" : "8dad9df3-820d-41ea-a3ab-a80c241bbc98",
  "firstname" : "Darth",
  "lastname" : "Doe",
  "_id" : "8dad9df3-820d-41ea-a3ab-a80c241bbc98"
}[
----
To verify that the sample is working, repeat the process. Set up a second user in the `xml_LDAP_Data.xml` file. An example of how that file might appear with a second user (`GDOE1`) is shown here:

[source, xml]

----
Rerun the reconciliation and query REST commands shown previously. The reconciliation operation creates the new user from the simulated LDAP resource in the OpenIDM repository. An implicit synchronization operation then creates that user in the AD resource.



[#more-sample-5b]
=== Sample 5b - Failure Compensation With Multiple Resources

The compensated synchronization mechanism depicted in this sample can help manage the risks associated with synchronizing data across multiple resources.

Typically, when a managed/user object is changed, implicit synchronization replays that change to all configured external resources. If synchronization fails for one target resource (for example, due to a policy validation failure on the target, or the target being unavailable), the synchronization operation stops at that point. The effect is that a record might be changed in the repository, and in the targets on which synchronization was successful, but not on the failed target, or any targets that would have been synchronized after the failure. This situation can result in disparate data sets across resources. While a reconciliation operation would eventually bring all targets back in sync, reconciliation can be an expensive operation with large data sets.

The compensated synchronization mechanism ensures that either all resources are synchronized successfully, or that the original change is rolled back. This mechanism uses an `onSync` script hook configured with a `compensate.js` script that can be used to "revert" the partial change to managed/user and to the corresponding external resources.

Sample 5b is similar to sample 5 in that it simulates two external resources with XML files (located in the `sample5b/data` directory). The `xml_LDAP_Data.xml` file simulates an LDAP data source. OpenIDM creates the `xml_AD_Data.xml` file when you start OpenIDM with the sample. Sample 5b adds the `onSync` script hook to the process, configured in the `sample5b/conf/managed.json` file.

The following excerpt of the `managed.json` file shows the `onSync` hook, which calls the `compensate.js` script, provided in the `/path/to/openidm/bin/defaults/script` directory.

[source, json]
----
...
},
"onSync" : {
   "type" : "text/javascript",
   "file" : "compensate.js"
},
----
You can use the `onSync` script hook to ensure that changes made in the repository are synchronized to all external resources, or that no changes are made. For more information about how implicit synchronization uses the `onSync` script hook, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#sync-failure-compensation["Configuring Synchronization Failure Compensation"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

You can optionally configure an outbound email service for this sample, if you want to receive emailed reconciliation summaries. The email service configuration is identical to that of sample 5 (xref:#email-sample5["Configure Email for the Sample"]).

[#install-sample5b]
==== Install the Sample

No external configuration is required for this sample. Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration of sample 5b.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/sample5b
----
The XML files that simulate an external LDAP and AD resource are now located in the `openidm/samples/sample5b/data/` directory. The simulated AD data store file, `xml_AD_Data.xml`, does not contain users until you run reconciliation.

Run the sample in exactly the same way that you did for Sample 5, following the steps in xref:#run-sample5["Run the Sample"]. Those steps will reconcile a user to your internal managed user repository.

Unless you run the steps in xref:#run-sample5["Run the Sample"], you will not be able to run the steps in the next section.


[#onsync-sample5b]
==== Demonstrate onSync

To demonstrate integration of the samples with the OpenIDM UI, this sample uses the UI to view and make changes to user objects in the repository. However, you can also use the REST interface to make these changes, as shown in the previous section.

Log into the OpenIDM UI as the administrative user. On a local system, navigate to `\https://localhost:8443/admin`. The default administrative account and password are both `openidm-admin`.

Select Manage > User. Make a change to the data of an existing user (`DDOE1`). As a result of the implicit synchronization from the managed object repository, that change is reflected almost immediately on the external resources. For sample 5b, you should see the changes in both XML files in the `sample5b/data` directory. Alternatively, you can query the external resources over REST, as described previously.

The synchronization is successful, across all configured external resources, so the updated user record can be seen in both the `xml_LDAP_Data.xml` and `xml_AD_Data.xml` files.

The next step is to simulate a problem connecting to the LDAP resource. One way to do so on the local system is to rename the LDAP data file so that it is unreadable. On a Linux system, the following command, as an administrative user, would serve that purpose:

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm/samples/sample5b/data
$ sudo mv xml_LDAP_Data.xml xml_LDAP_Data.xml.bak
----
In the UI, now try another update to user `DDOE1`. With the modified filename of the simulated LDAP resource, implicit synchronization cannot write to this resource. An error similar to the following is displayed in the log file, `openidm0.log.0`:

[source, console]
----
Data file does not exist:
/path/to/openidm/samples/sample5b/data/xml_LDAP_Data.xml
----
Although the AD resource is available, implicit synchronization will not reach this resource, because the mapping is specified __after__ the managed/user to LDAP mapping in the `sync.json` file.

When the implicit synchronization operation fails for the LDAP resource, the `onSync` hook invokes the `compensate.js` script. This script attempts to revert the original change by performing another update to DDOE1 in the repository (managed/user). This change, in turn, triggers another automatic synchronization to the AD and LDAP resources.

Because the LDAP resource is still unreadable, the synchronization to LDAP fails again, which triggers the `compensate.js` script again. This time, however, the script recognizes that the change was originally called as a result of a compensation and aborts.

The original synchronization error from the first update is thrown from the script and the UI should display that error. If you refresh the UI, and view that user entry again, you will notice that the change to the entry has been reverted.

Note that if you change the name of the AD resource file (to make it unavailable), a change to a managed/user entry will be synchronized successfully with the LDAP resource (because that mapping appears first in `sync.json`). The synchronization will fail for the AD resource. In this case, the change will be reverted on both the managed/user entry, and the LDAP resource.



[#more-sample-6]
=== Sample 6 - LiveSync With an AD Server

Sample 6 resembles sample 5, but demonstrates LiveSync from an external resource. Sample 6 includes configuration files for two scenarios, depending on whether you have a live Active Directory (AD) service, or whether you need to simulate an AD service with an OpenDJ server. Each scenario is associated with a file in the `sample6/alternatives` directory. Depending on your scenario, copy the corresponding file to the `sample6/conf` directory.
--

Active AD Deployment::
If you have an actual AD deployment available, copy the `provisioner.openicf-realad.json` file to the `conf/` subdirectory. You can then configure synchronization between an OpenDJ Directory Server and an active AD deployment.

+
As this sample demonstrates synchronization __from__ the AD server __to__ OpenDJ, data on the AD server is not changed.

Simulated AD Deployment::
If you need to simulate an AD deployment, copy the `provisioner.openicf-fakead.json` file to the `conf/` subdirectory. You can then configure synchronization between an OpenDJ Directory server and a simulated AD server.

+
This sample simulates an AD server on the same instance of OpenDJ, using a different base DN.

--
The options shown in the associated configuration files can be easily modified to work with any standard LDAP server.

[#more-sample6-realad]
==== Sample 6 with an Active AD Deployment

If you have an existing, active instance of AD, set up OpenDJ, as described in the link:../../../opendj/install-guide[OpenDJ Installation Guide, window=\_blank].

During installation, populate OpenDJ with the data in the `Example.ldif` file, available in the `sample6/data` directory.

The actions run in this sample should not change any data on the AD server.


[#d5830e2637]
==== Sample 6 with a Simulated AD Deployment

In this sample, an AD deployment is simulated with a different baseDN (`dc=fakead,dc=com`) on the same OpenDJ server instance. You can also simulate the AD server with a separate OpenDJ instance, running on the same host, as long as the two instances communicate on different ports. The data for the simulated AD instance is contained in the file `AD.ldif`. The data for the OpenDJ instance is contained in the file `Example.ldif`.


[#external-resource-sample6]
==== External Configuration


[#prepare-livesync-sample6]
===== Prepare OpenDJ For LiveSync

This sample assumes a replicated OpenDJ server on the localhost system. When configured, OpenDJ replication includes an External Change Log (ECL), required to support LiveSync. LiveSync detects changes in OpenDJ by reading the ECL.

Follow these steps to install and configure an OpenDJ instance.

====

. Download and extract the OpenDJ zip archive from the link:https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases[GitHub, window=\_blank].

. Install OpenDJ using the command-line setup, and import the data file for this sample, as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/opendj

----
+
The sample assumes the following configuration:
+

* The OpenDJ server is installed on the localhost.

* The server listens for LDAP connections on port 1389.

* The administration connector port is 4444.

* The root user DN is `cn=Directory Manager`.

* The root user password is `password`.


. Configure the OpenDJ server for replication.
+
To enable liveSync, this server must be configured for replication, even if it does not actually participate in a replication topology. The following commands configure the server for replication.
+

[source, console]
----
$ ./dsconfig create-replication-server \
 --hostname localhost \
 --port 4444 \

====
Once OpenDJ is configured, you can proceed with either an active or simulated AD deployment.


[#external-resource-sample6-active]
===== External Configuration for an Active AD Deployment

To configure an active AD deployment for sample 6, open the `provisioner.openicf-realad.json` file in a text editor. Update it as needed. At minimum, you should check and if needed update the following parameters in that file, as shown in the following table:

[#realad-json-configuration]
.Key Parameters for an Active AD Configuration
[cols="40%,60%"]
|===
|Option |Description 

a|host
a|The hostname/IP address of the AD server

a|port
a|The LDAP port; the default is 389.

a|ssl
a|By default, SSL is not used.

a|principal
a|The full DN of the account to bind with, such as "CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com"

a|credentials
a|If a password is used, replace null with that password. When OpenIDM starts, it encrypts that password in the `provisioner.openicf-realad.conf` file.

a|baseContexts
a|The DNs for account containers, such as ["CN=Users,DC=Example,DC=com"]

a|baseContextsToSynchronize
a|Set to the same value as `baseContexts`

a|accountSearchFilter

|===
If you do not want to filter out computer and disabled user accounts, set the `accountSearchFilter` and `accountSynchronizationFilter` to `null`.


[#external-resource-sample6-simulated]
===== External Configuration for a Simulated AD Deployment

Not everyone has a testable instance of AD readily available. For such administrators, you can use the `AD.ldif` file from the `data/` subdirectory to simulate an AD deployment.

If you have not already done so, copy the `provisioner.openicf-fakead.json` file to the `conf` subdirectory.

As previously mentioned, you can use a separate OpenDJ instance to simulate the AD server. However, the following instructions assume that the simulated AD server runs on the same OpenDJ instance.

Open the `provisioner.openicf-fakead.json` file and note the following:

* OpenDJ directory server uses port 1389 by default for users who cannot use privileged ports, so this is the port that is specified in the provisioner file. Adjust the port if your OpenDJ server is listening on a different port.

* The simulated AD server uses the base DN `dc=fakead,dc=com`.

To load the data for the simulated AD instance, launch the OpenDJ control panel, add the simulated AD baseDN (`dc=fakead,dc=com`), and then import the `sample6/data/AD.ldif` file. When you import the `AD.ldif` file, select "Append to Existing Data", not "Overwrite Existing Data". Otherwise, the data in the `dc=example,dc=com` baseDN will be overwritten.

Alternatively, you could run the following command:

[source, console]
----
$  cd /path/to/opendj/bin
$ ./ldapmodify \
--defaultAdd \
--bindDN "cn=Directory Manager" \
--bindPassword password \
--hostname localhost \
--port 1389 \
--filename /path/to/openidm/samples/sample6/data/AD.ldif
----



[#install-sample6]
==== Start OpenIDM with Sample 6

Now that OpenDJ and a real or simulated AD database is configured, prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"]. You can then start OpenIDM with the configuration for sample 6.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/sample6
----


[#run-sample6]
==== Run the Sample

The following sections show how to run the sample with command-based reconciliation with a REST call, and to configure scheduled reconciliation with LiveSync.

[#run-sample6-reconciliation]
===== Using Reconciliation

Now that OpenIDM is in operation, review the entries in the OpenDJ data store. When you run reconciliation, any entries that share the same `uid` with the AD data store will be updated with the contents from AD.

If you have set up the simulated AD data store as described in xref:#external-resource-sample6-simulated["External Configuration for a Simulated AD Deployment"], compare the entries for `uid=jdoe` as shown in the `AD.ldif` and `Example.ldif` files. Note the different values of `givenName` for `uid=jdoe`.

Run reconciliation over the REST interface. If you have followed the instructions for the simulated AD data store, the following command takes the information for user `jdoe` imported from the `AD.ldif` file, with a `givenName` of Johnny, and synchronizes that information to the LDAP database, overwriting the `givenName` of John for that same user `jdoe`.

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request POST \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemAdAccounts_managedUser&waitForCompletion=true"
----
The reconciliation operation returns a reconciliation run ID, and the status of the operation.

[source, console]
----
{
  "state": "SUCCESS",
  "_id": "985ee939-fbe1-4607-a757-00b404b4ef77"
}
----
The reconciliation operation synchronizes the data in the AD server with the OpenIDM repository (managed/user). That information is then automatically synchronized to the OpenDJ server, as described in xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#handling-sync["Synchronization Situations and Actions"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

After reconciliation, list all users in the OpenDJ server data store.

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/system/ldap/account?_queryId=query-all-ids"
----
The result should resemble the following JSON object.

[source, json]
----
{
  "result": [ {
     "dn" : "uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
     "_id" : "uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
     }, {
     "dn" : "uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
     "_id" : "uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
    } ],
...
}
----
You see only two entries, as the `uid=jdoe` entry from `dc=fakead,dc=com` overwrites the original LDAP entry for `uid=jdoe` in the reconciled LDAP data store.

To read the user object in the OpenDJ server, run the `ldapsearch` command. The following example returns the entry for user `uid=jdoe`:

[source, console]
----
$ ./ldapsearch \
 --port 1389 \
 --baseDN dc=example,dc=com \
 "(uid=jdoe)"
----


[#run-sample6-live-sync]
===== Using LiveSync

You can trigger a reconciliation operation by configuring a schedule, or by launching the operation directly over the REST interface. You can also launch a LiveSync operation over REST, but LiveSync requires a configured schedule to poll for changes. When this sample's default LiveSync schedule (`schedule-activeSynchroniser_systemAdAccount.json`) is enabled, a LiveSync operation is launched every 15 seconds.

LiveSync pushes changes made in the AD data store to the OpenIDM repository, automatically.

The LiveSync schedule is disabled by default. To activate LiveSync, change the value of the `"enabled"` property from `false` to `true`.

[source, json]
----
{
    "enabled" : false,
    "type" : "cron",
    "schedule" : "0/15 * * * * ?",
    "invokeService" : "provisioner",
    "invokeContext" : {
        "action" : "liveSync",
        "source" : "system/ad/account"
    },
    "invokeLogLevel" : "debug"
}
----

[#test-live-sync]
.Testing LiveSync
====
Now you can test LiveSync. This procedure assumes that you have configured OpenDJ using the parameters and commands described in this section.

. Create an LDIF file with a new user entry (`uid=bsmith`) that will be added to the simulated AD data store.

. The following is the contents of a sample `bsmith.ldif` file for demonstration purposes:
+

[source, console]
----
dn: uid=bsmith,ou=People,dc=fakead,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: top
givenName: Barry
description: Created to see LiveSync work
uid: bsmith
cn: Barry
sn: Smith
mail: bsmith@example.com
telephoneNumber: 1-415-523-0772
userPassword: passw0rd
----
+

. Navigate to the `/path/to/opendj/bin` directory.

. Use the `ldapmodify` command to add the `bsmith.ldif` file to the directory.
+

[source, console]
----
$ ./ldapmodify \
 --port 1389 \
 --defaultAdd \
 --bindDN "cn=Directory Manager" \
 --bindPassword password \
 --filename /path/to/bsmith.ldif
----

. Now you can test synchronization by viewing the new user in the OpenIDM repository. The easiest way to do this, is through OpenIDM UI. You should be able to log into the UI with any of the accounts in the AD data store. For this example, log into the UI as user `bsmith`, with password `passw0rd`. The fact that you can log into the UI as this new user indicates that LiveSync has synchronized the user from the AD data store to the managed/user repository.

. Implicit synchronization pushes this change out to the OpenDJ data store. To test this synchronization operation, search the OpenDJ baseDN for the new user entry.
+

[source, console]
----
$ ./ldapsearch \
 --port 1389 \
 --baseDN ou=people,dc=example,dc=com \
 "(uid=bsmith)"
----

[#sample-historical-accounts]
=== Linking Historical Accounts

This sample demonstrates the retention of inactive (historical) LDAP accounts that have been linked to a corresponding managed user account. The sample builds on sample 2b and uses the LDAP connector to connect to an OpenDJ instance. You can use any LDAP-v3 compliant directory server.

In this sample, OpenIDM is the source resource. Managed users in the OpenIDM repository maintain a list of the accounts that they have been linked to on the local LDAP server. This list is stored in the `historicalAccounts` field of the managed user entry. The list contains a reference to all past and current LDAP accounts. Each LDAP account in the list is represented as a __relationship__ and includes information about the date the accounts were linked or unlinked, and whether the account is currently active. For more information about relationship objects, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-users-groups-roles.adoc#managing-relationships["Managing Relationships Between Objects"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.
This sample includes the following custom scripts, in its `script` directory:

* `onLink-managedUser_systemLdapAccounts.js`
+
When a managed user object is linked to a target LDAP object, this script creates the relationship entry in the managed user's `historicalAccounts` property. The script adds two relationship properties:
+

** `linkDate` — specifies the date that the link was created.

** `active` — boolean true/false. When set to true, this property indicates that the target object is __currently__ linked to the managed user account.


* `onUnlink-managedUser_systemLdapAccounts.js`
+
When a managed user object is unlinked from a target LDAP object, this script updates that relationship entry's properties with an `unlinkDate` that specifies when the target was unlinked, and sets the `active` property to false, indicating that the target object is no longer linked.

* `check_account_state_change.js`
+
During LiveSync or reconciliation, this script checks if the LDAP account state has changed. If the state has changed, the script updates the historical account properties to indicate the new state (enabled or disabled), and the date that the state was changed. This date can only be approximated and is set to the time that the change was detected by the script.

* `ldapBackCorrelationQuery.js`
+
This script correlates entries in the LDAP directory with managed user identities in OpenIDM.


[#ldap-config-historical-accounts]
==== Configuring the LDAP Server

This sample expects the configuration for the external LDAP server to be the same as described in xref:#external-ldap-config-2["LDAP Server Configuration"].

The following steps provide setup instructions for an OpenDJ server. Adjust these instructions if you are using an alternative LDAP server.

The LDIF data for this sample is provided in the file `openidm/samples/historicalaccountlinking/data/Example.ldif`. You will need to import this data during your OpenDJ setup.

Although there is only one LDAP server in this example, you must enable __replication__ on that server, so that the server has an external change log. The change log is required for LiveSync between OpenDJ and OpenIDM.

====

. Download OpenDJ from the link:https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases[GitHub, window=\_top] and extract the zip archive.

. Install OpenDJ, using either the UI or the command-line setup.
+

* If you use the UI, make sure that you enable replication, and import the Example.ldif file during the installation.

* If you use the command-line setup, import the Example.ldif file during the setup, then enable replication when the server has started:
+

[#run-sample-historical-accounts]
==== Running the Historical Accounts Sample

This section walks you through each step of the sample to demonstrate how historical accounts are stored.

====

. Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration for the historical accounts sample:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm

----

. Create a user, Joe Smith, in OpenIDM.
+
The following command creates the user over REST, and assigns the user the ID `joesmith`:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --request POST \
 --data '{
     "userName": "joe.smith",
     "givenName": "Joe",
     "sn" : "Smith",
     "password" : "Passw0rd",
     "displayName" : "Joe Smith",
     "mail" : "joe.smith@example.com",
     "_id" : "joesmith"
 }' \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user?_action=create"
{
  "_id": "joesmith",
  "_rev": "1",
  "userName": "joe.smith",
  "givenName": "Joe",
  "sn": "Smith",
  "displayName": "Joe Smith",
  "mail": "joe.smith@example.com",
  "accountStatus": "active",
  "effectiveRoles": [],
  "effectiveAssignments": []
}
----

. Verify that the user Joe Smith was created in OpenDJ.
+
Because implicit synchronization is enabled by default, any change to the managed/user repository should be propagated to OpenDJ. For more information about implicit synchronization, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#sync-types["Types of Synchronization"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.
+
The following command returns all IDs in OpenDJ and shows that user joesmith was created successfully:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/system/ldap/account?_queryId=query-all-ids"
{
  "result": [
    {
      "_id": "uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
      "dn": "uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
    },
    {
      "_id": "uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
      "dn": "uid=bjensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
    },
    {
      "_id": "uid=joe.smith0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
      "dn": "uid=joe.smith0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
    }
  ],
...
}
----
+
Note that Joe Smith's `uid` in OpenDJ is appended with a `0`. The `onCreate` script, defined in the mapping (`sync.json`), increments the `uid` each time a new OpenDJ entry is linked to the same managed user object.

. Verify that the historical account __relationship object__ that corresponds to this linked LDAP account was created in the OpenIDM repository.
+
The following command returns all of the `historicalAccounts` for user joesmith:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user/joesmith/historicalAccounts?_queryId=query-all"
{
  "result": [
    {
      "_ref": "system/ldap/account/uid=joe.smith0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
      "_refProperties": {
        "stateLastChanged": "Mon Nov 30 2015 14:45:22 GMT-0800 (PST)",
        "state": "enabled",
        "active": true,
        "linkDate": "Mon Nov 30 2015 14:45:22 GMT-0800 (PST)",
        "_id": "ff6913ce-a252-4dc9-a060-b8b56bb32bf4",
        "_rev": "1"
      }
    }
  ],
...
}
----
+
At this stage, Joe Smith has only one historical account link — the link to `uid=joe.smith0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`. Note that the relationship properties (`_refProperties`) show the following information about the linked accounts:
+

* The date on which the accounts were linked

* The fact that this link is currently active

* The state of the account in OpenDJ (`enabled`)


. Enable the LiveSync schedule to propagate changes made in OpenDJ to the managed user repository.
+
To start LiveSync, set `enabled` to `true` in the `conf/schedule-liveSync.json` file:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ more  samples/historicalaccountlinking/conf/schedule-liveSync.json
{
    "enabled" : true,
    "type" : "cron",
    "schedule" : "0/15 * * * * ?",
...
----

. Use the `manage-account` command in the `opendj/bin` directory to disable Joe Smith's account in OpenDJ:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/opendj
$ bin/manage-account set-account-is-disabled \
--port 4444 \
--bindDN "cn=Directory Manager" \
--bindPassword password \
--operationValue true \
--targetDN uid=joe.smith0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com \
--trustAll
Account Is Disabled:  true
----
+
Within 15 seconds, according to the configured schedule, LiveSync should pick up the change. OpenIDM should then adjust the `state` property in Joe Smith's managed user account.

. Check Joe Smith's historical accounts again, to make sure that the state of this linked account has changed:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user/joesmith/historicalAccounts?_queryId=query-all"
{
  "result": [
    {
      "_ref": "system/ldap/account/uid=joe.smith0,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
      "_refProperties": {
        "stateLastChanged": "Mon Nov 30 2015 14:54:45 GMT-0800 (PST)",
        "state": "disabled",
        "active": true,
        "linkDate": "Mon Nov 30 2015 14:45:22 GMT-0800 (PST)",
        "_id": "ff6913ce-a252-4dc9-a060-b8b56bb32bf4",
        "_rev": "2"
      }
    }
  ],
...
}
----

. Now, deactivate Joe Smith's managed user account by setting his `accountStatus` property to inactive.
+
You can deactivate the account over the REST interface, or by using the Admin UI.
+
To use the Admin UI, simply select Manage > User, select Joe Smith's account and change his Status to inactive, on his Details tab.
+
The following command deactivates Joe Smith's account over REST:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \

        "_rev": "3"
      }
    }
  ],
...
}
----

. Activate Joe Smith's managed user account by setting his `accountStatus` property to active. This action should create a new entry in OpenDJ (with `uid=joe.smith1`), and a new link from Joe Smith's managed user object to that OpenDJ entry.
+
You can activate the account over the REST interface, or by using the Admin UI, as described previously.
+
The following command activates Joe Smith's account over REST:

  "_id": "joesmith",
  "_rev": "4",
  "userName": "joe.smith",
  ...
  "accountStatus": "active",
 ...
}
----

. Verify that a new LDAP entry for user Joe Smith was created in OpenDJ.

[#sample-multiple-passwords]
=== Storing Multiple Passwords For Managed Users

This sample demonstrates how to set up multiple passwords for managed users and how to synchronize separate passwords to different external resources. The sample assumes the following scenario:

* The managed/user repository is the source system.

* There are two target LDAP servers — `ldap` and `ldap2`.
+
For the purposes of this sample, the two servers are represented by two separate organizational units on a single OpenDJ instance.

* Managed user objects have two additional password fields, each mapped to one of the two LDAP servers.

* The two LDAP servers have different requirements for password policy and encryption.

* Both LDAP servers have a requirement for a password history policy, but the history size differs for the two policies.
+
The sample shows how to extend the password history policy, described in xref:../integrators-guide/chap-passwords.adoc#password-history["Creating a Password History Policy"] in the __Integrator's Guide__, to apply to multiple password fields.

* The value of a managed user's `password` field is used by default for the additional passwords __unless__ the CREATE, UPDATE, or PATCH requests on the managed user explicitly contain a value for these additional passwords.

The sample includes the following customized configuration files in the `conf` directory:

* `provisioner.openicf-ldap.json` configures the first LDAP connection.

* `conf/provisioner.openicf-ldap2.json` configures the second LDAP connection.

* `sync.json` provides the mappings from the OpenIDM managed user repository to the respective LDAP servers.

* `managed.json` contains a customized schema for managed users that includes the additional password fields.

For details of the customizations to these configuration files, see the `README` provided with the sample.
The sample includes the following customized scripts in the `script` directory:

* `onCreate-onUpdate-sync.js` performs custom mapping logic. Specifically, this script maps the pre-hashed password value and sets the target object DN on create events.

* `storeFields.groovy` stores the pre-hashed values of fields in the context chain, on validate events.

* `onCreate-user-custom.js` and `onUpdate-user-custom.js` are used for validation of the password history policy when a user is created or updated.

* `pwpolicy.js` is an additional policy script for the password history policy.

* `set-additional-passwords.js` populates the values of the additional password fields with the value of the main `password` field if the additional fields are not included in the request content.


[NOTE]
====
This sample does not support creation of new users in the Admin UI.
====

[#multiple-passwords-history-policy]
==== Understanding the Password History Policy

The sample includes a custom password history policy. Although the sample is concerned only about the history of passwords, you can use this policy to enforce history validation on any managed object property.

The following configuration changes set up the password history policy:

* A `fieldHistory` property is added to managed users. The value of this field is a map of field names to a list of historical values for that field. These lists of values are used by the policy to determine if a new value has previously been used.

* The `onCreate-user-custom.js` script performs the standard `onCreate` tasks for a managed user object but also stores the initial value of each of the fields that OpenIDM must keep a history of. The script is passed the following configurable properties:
+

** `historyFields` — a list of the fields to store history on.

** `historySize` — the number of historical fields to store.


* The `onUpdate-user-custom.js` compares the old and new values of the historical fields on update events, to determine if the values have changed. When a new value is detected, it is stored in the list of historical values for that field.
+
This script also contains logic to deal with the comparison of encrypted or hashed field values. The script is passed the following configurable properties:
+

** `historyFields` — a list of the fields to store history on.

** `historySize` — the number of historical fields to store.


* The `pwpolicy.js` script contains the additional policy definition for the historical password policy. This script compares the new field value with the values in the list of historical values for each field.
+
The `policy.json` configuration includes this script in its `additionalFiles` list, so that the policy service loads the new policy definition. The new policy takes a `historyLength` parameter, which indicates the number of historical values to enforce the policy on. This number must not exceed the `historySize` specified in the `onCreate` and `onUpdate` scripts.

* The `ldapPassword` and `ldap2Password` fields in the managed user schema have been updated with the policy. For the purposes of this sample the `historySize` has been set to 2 for `ldapPassword` and to 4 for `ldap2Password`.



[#ldap-config-multiple-passwords]
==== Configuring the LDAP Server

This sample expects the configuration for the external LDAP server to be the same as described in xref:#external-ldap-config-2["LDAP Server Configuration"].

The following steps provide setup instructions for an OpenDJ server. Adjust these instructions if you are using an alternative LDAP server.

The LDIF data for this sample is provided in the file `openidm/samples/multiplepasswords/data/Example.ldif`. You will need to import this data during your OpenDJ setup.

====

. Download OpenDJ from the link:https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases[GitHub, window=\_top] and extract the zip archive.

. Install OpenDJ, using either the UI or the command-line setup.
+
If you use the UI, import the Example.ldif file during the installation.
+
If you use the command-line setup, import the Example.ldif file during the setup as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/opendj
$ ./setup --cli \
--hostname localhost \
--ldapPort 1389 \
--rootUserDN "cn=Directory Manager" \
--rootUserPassword password \
--adminConnectorPort 4444 \
--baseDN dc=com \
--ldifFile /path/to/openidm/samples/multiplepasswords/data/Example.ldif \
--acceptLicense \
--no-prompt
...
Configuring Directory Server ..... Done.
Importing LDIF file /path/to/openidm/samples/multiplepasswords/data/Example.ldif ...... Done.
Starting Directory Server ...... Done.
...
----

. Run an `ldapsearch` on the LDAP directory and look at the organizational units:
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/opendj
$ bin/ldapsearch \
--hostname localhost \
--port 1389 \
--bindDN "cn=directory manager" \
--bindPassword password \
--baseDN "dc=example,dc=com" \
"ou=*" \
ou
dn: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
ou: people

dn: ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com
ou: people
ou: Customers
----
+
The organizational units, `ou=People` and `ou=Customers`, represent the two different target LDAP systems that our mappings point to.

[#run-sample-multiple-passwords]
==== Demonstrating the Use of Multiple Accounts

This section starts OpenIDM with the sample configuration, then creates a user with multiple passwords, adhering to the different policies in the configured password policy. The section tests that the user was synchronized to two separate LDAP directories, with the different required passwords, and that the user can bind to each of these LDAP directories.

====

. Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the configuration for the multiple passwords sample.
+

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/multiplepasswords
----

. Create a user in OpenIDM. Include a main `password` field but no additional password fields. The additional password fields (`ldapPassword` and `ldap2Password`) will be populated with the value of the main `password` field as a result of the script described previously.
+
For the purposes of this example, we will not use the Admin UI, so that the result of each command can be clearly seen. Create the user over REST, by running the following command:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --request PUT \
 --data '{
   "userName": "jdoe",
   "givenName": "John",
   "sn" : "Doe",
   "displayName" : "John Doe",
   "mail" : "john.doe@example.com",
   "password" : "Passw0rd"
 }' \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/managed/user/jdoe"
{
  "code": 403,
  "reason": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Policy validation failed",
  "detail": {
    "result": false,
    "failedPolicyRequirements": [
      {
        "policyRequirements": [
          {
            "policyRequirement": "AT_LEAST_X_CAPITAL_LETTERS",
            "params": {
              "numCaps": 2
            }
          }
        ],
        "property": "ldapPassword"
      },
      {
        "policyRequirements": [
          {
            "policyRequirement": "AT_LEAST_X_NUMBERS",
            "params": {
              "numNums": 2
            }
          }
        ],
        "property": "ldap2Password"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
+
Notice that the create request failed with a policy validation failure on the two new password fields. Although the password met the requirement for the main `password` field, the user could not be created because the password did not meet the requirements of the `ldapPassword` and `ldap2Password` fields.
+
You can fix this problem either by updating the `password` field to one that passes both of the new requirements, or by updating the individual password fields to specifically pass their individual validation requirements.

. Now, try to create user jdoe again, this time providing individual values for each of the different password fields, that comply with the three different password policies:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --header "Content-Type: application/json" \

        "algorithm": "SHA-256",
        "data": "CpbVZlXAEFL/LUqWyq9Bcks/tLVwJ0pHrc/smLWf8UmC/0BDtEKRo1o2IjB6mNFz"
      },
      "type": "salted-hash"
    }
  },
  "ldap2Password": {
    "$crypto": {
      "value": {
        "iv": "TbJlRF+cSFeOguclh8AZVg==",
        "data": "zQ250CXfR3QJ3cBKjpCQhQ==",
        "cipher": "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding",
        "key": "openidm-sym-default"
      },
      "type": "x-simple-encryption"
    }
  },
...
}
----
+
The user has been created with three different passwords that comply with three distinct password policies. The passwords have been hashed or encrypted, as defined in the `managed.json` file.

. As a result of implicit synchronization, two separate LDAP accounts should have been created for user jdoe on our two simulated LDAP servers. For more information about implicit synchronization, see xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#sync-types["Types of Synchronization"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

. Query the IDs in the LDAP directory as follows:
+

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "http://localhost:8080/openidm/system/ldap/account?_queryId=query-all-ids"
{
  "result" : [ {
    "_id" : "uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",
    "dn" : "uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
  }, {
    "_id" : "uid=jdoe,ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com",
    "dn" : "uid=jdoe,ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com"
  } ],
...
}
----
+
Note that jdoe has two entries - one in `ou=People` and one in `ou=Customers`.

. Now, see if you can search each LDAP server, as user jdoe, with the separate passwords that you created for each directory.
+
This step will indicate that the passwords were propagated correctly to the separate LDAP servers.
+
