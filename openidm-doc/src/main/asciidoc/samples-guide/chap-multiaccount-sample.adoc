[#chap-multiaccount-sample]
== The Multi-Account Linking Sample

The sample provided in the `samples/multiaccountlinking` directory illustrates how OpenIDM addresses links from multiple accounts to one identity.

This sample is based on a common use case in the insurance industry, where a company (Example.com) employs agents to sell policies to their insured customers. Most of their agents are also insured. These different roles are sometimes known as the multi-account linking conundrum.

With minor changes, this sample works for other use cases. For example, you may have a hospital that employs doctors who treat patients. Some of their doctors are also patients of that hospital.

[#external-ldap-config-multiaccount]
=== External LDAP Configuration

Configure the LDAP server as for sample 2, (see xref:chap-ldap-samples.adoc#external-ldap-config-2["LDAP Server Configuration"]).

The LDAP user must have write access to create users from OpenIDM on the LDAP server. When you configure the LDAP server, import the appropriate LDIF file, in this case, __openidm/samples/multiaccountlinking/data/Example.ldif__.


[#install-sample-multiaccount]
=== Install the Sample

Prepare OpenIDM as described in xref:chap-overview.adoc#preparing-openidm["Preparing OpenIDM"], then start OpenIDM with the following configuration for the Multi-Account Linking sample.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/openidm
----

[source, console]
----
$ ./startup.sh -p samples/multiaccountlinking
----


[#multiaccount-create-users]
=== Create New Identities for the Sample

For the purpose of this sample, create identities for users John Doe and Barbara Jensen. To create these identities from the Admin UI, navigate to `\https://localhost:8443/admin` and click Manage > User > New User.

Alternatively, use the following REST calls to set up identities for the noted users:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--request POST \
--data '{
  "displayName" : "Barbara Jensen",
  "description" : "Created for OpenIDM",
  "givenName" : "Barbara",
  "mail" : "bjensen@example.com",
  "telephoneNumber" : "1-360-229-7105",
  "sn" : "Jensen",
  "userName" : "bjensen",
  "accountStatus" : "active"
}' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_action=create"
----

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--request POST \
--data '{
  "displayName" : "John Doe",
  "description" : "Created for OpenIDM",
  "givenName" : "John",
  "mail" : "jdoe@example.com",
  "telephoneNumber" : "1-415-599-1100",
  "sn" : "Doe",
  "userName" : "jdoe",
  "accountStatus" : "active"
}' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_action=create"
----
In the output, you will see an ID number associated with each user, in the following format:

[source, console]
----
"_id" : "35d0a49d-2571-401f-b429-96c66b23a1c0",
----
Record the `_id` number for each user. You will use those numbers to assign desired roles for each user.


[#multiaccount-create-roles]
=== Create New Roles for the Sample

For this sample, to set up links for multiple accounts on OpenIDM, you need to set up roles. To do so, set up roles for `Agent` and `Insured`. To create these roles in the Admin UI, navigate to `\https://localhost:8443/admin` and click Manage > Role > New Role.

Alternatively, use the following REST calls to set up the `Agent` and `Insured` roles:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--request POST \
--data '{
  "name" : "Agent",
  "description" : "Role assigned to insurance agents."
}' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/role?_action=create"
----

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--request POST \
--data '{
  "name" : "Insured",
  "description" : "Role assigned to insured customers."
}' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/role?_action=create"
----
Do record the `_id` output for the `Agent` and `Insured` roles. You will use those numbers to assign desired roles for each user.

[NOTE]
====
While you could use `PUT` to create roles with descriptive names, we recommend that you use `POST` to create roles with immutable IDs.
====


[#multiaccount-assign-roles]
=== Assign Roles to Appropriate Users

Now you can assign roles to appropriate users. To review, user `jdoe` is an `Agent` and user `bjensen` is `Insured`.

You will need the `_id` value for each user. The `_id` values shown in the following commands are random; substitute the `_id` values that you collected when creating users.

The following command adds the `Agent` role to user `jdoe`, by their `_id` values:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "If-Match: *" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[
    {
      "operation" : "add",
      "field" : "/roles/-",
      "value" : {
        "_ref" : "managed/role/287dc4b1-4b19-49ec-8b4c-28a6c12ede34"
      }
    }
  ]' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user/8fae84ed-1f30-4542-8087-e7fa6e89541c"
----
And this next command adds the `Insured` role to user `bjensen`:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "If-Match: *" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[
    {
      "operation" : "add",
      "field" : "/roles/-",
      "value" : {
        "_ref" : "managed/role/bb9302c4-5fc1-462c-8be2-b17c87175d1b"
      }
    }
  ]' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user/d0b79f30-946f-413a-b7d1-d813034fa345"
----
Now assign the `Insured` role to user `jdoe`, as that user is both an insured customer and an agent:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "If-Match: *" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[
    {
      "operation" : "add",
      "field" : "/roles/-",
      "value" : {
        "_ref" : "managed/role/006935c2-b080-45cd-8347-881df42cae0c"
      }
    }
  ]' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user/a3335177-7366-4656-a66c-8d6e77a5786f"
----
User `jdoe` should now have two managed roles:

[source, console]
----
...
"effectiveRoles" : [ {
  "_ref" : "managed/role/6aabe990-ec05-403e-bc5d-ff9b217ba571",
  "_refProperties" : {
    "_id" : "687714b8-5854-42c7-a190-c781ea5174c5",
    "_rev" : "1"
  }
}, {
  "_ref" : "managed/role/844110ce-3686-43bb-aabf-46b17a14abaa"
} ],
...
----


[#multiaccount-background]
=== Background: Link Qualifiers, Agents, and Insured Customers

This is a good moment to take a step back, to see how this sample works, based on custom options in the `sync.json` configuration file.

OpenIDM defines mappings between source and target accounts in the `sync.json` file, which allows you to create a link between one source entry and multiple target entries using a concept known as a "link qualifier," which enables one-to-many relationships in mappings and policies.

For more information on resource mappings and link qualifiers, see the following sections of the Integratorâ€™s Guide:

xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#synchronization-mappings-file["Mapping Source Objects to Target Objects"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

xref:../integrators-guide/chap-synchronization.adoc#linking-multiple-targets["Mapping a Single Source Object to Multiple Target Objects"] in the __Integrator's Guide__.

In this sample, we use two link qualifiers:

* `insured`+
`ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com`
* `agent`+
`ou=Contractors,dc=example,dc=com`
Assume that agents and insured customers connect via two different portals. Each group gets access to different features, depending on the portal.

Agents may have two different accounts; one each for professional and personal use. While the accounts are different, the identity information for each agent should be the same for both accounts.

To that end, this sample sets up link qualifiers for two categories of users: `insured` and `agent`, under the `managedUser_systemLdapAccounts` mapping:

[source, javascript]
----
{
  "name" : "managedUser_systemLdapAccounts",
  "source" : "managed/user",
  "target" : "system/ldap/account",
  "linkQualifiers" : [
    "insured",
    "agent"
  ],
  .....
}
----
You can verify this in the Admin UI. Click Configure > Mappings > `managedUser_systemLdapAccounts` > Properties > Link Qualifiers. You should see `insured` and `agent` in the list of configured Link Qualifiers.

In addition, this sample also includes a transformation script between an LDAP Distinguished Name (`dn`) and the two categories of users. The following excerpt of the `sync.json` file includes that script:

[source, javascript]
----
{
   "target" : "dn",
   "transform" : {
      "type" : "text/javascript",
      "globals" : { },
      "source" :
         "if (linkQualifier === 'agent') {
            'uid=' + source.userName + ',ou=Contractors,dc=example,dc=com';
         } else if (linkQualifier === 'insured') {
            'uid=' + source.userName + ',ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com';
         }"
},
----
The following validSource script looks through the effective roles of a user, with two objectives:

* `Agent`+
`Insured`
* `effectiveRoles`+
`Agent`+
`Insured`

[source, javascript]
----
"validSource" : {
  "type" : "text/javascript",
  "globals" : { },
  "source" : "var res = false;
    var i=0;

    while (!res && i < source.effectiveRoles.length) {
      var roleId = source.effectiveRoles[i];
      if (roleId != null && roleId.indexOf("/") != -1) {
        var roleInfo = openidm.read(roleId);
        logger.warn("Role Info : {}",roleInfo);
        res = (((roleInfo.properties.name === 'Agent')
          &&(linkQualifier ==='agent'))
        || ((roleInfo.properties.name === 'Insured')
          &&(linkQualifier ==='insured')));
        }
        i++;
      }
      res"
}
----
You can see how correlation queries are configured in the `sync.json` file.

The structure for the correlation query specifies one of two link qualifiers: `insured` or `agent`. For each link qualifier, the correlation query defines a script that verifies if the subject `dn` belongs in a specific container. For this sample, the container (`ou`) may be Customers or Contractors.

You can can avoid specifying the structure of the `dn` attribute in two places in the `sync.json` file with the following code, which leverages the expression builder to reuse the construct defined in the `dn` mapping:

[source, javascript]
----
"correlationQuery" : [
  {
    "linkQualifier" : "insured",
    "expressionTree" : {
      "all" : [
        "dn"
      ]
    },
    "mapping" : "managedUser_systemLdapAccounts",
    "type" : "text/javascript",
    "file" : "ui/correlateTreeToQueryFilter.js"
  },
  {
    "linkQualifier" : "agent",
    "expressionTree" : {
      "all" : [
        "dn"
      ]
    },
    "mapping" : "managedUser_systemLdapAccounts",
    "type" : "text/javascript",
    "file" : "ui/correlateTreeToQueryFilter.js"
  }
],
----
You can also leverage the expression builder in the UI. Review how the UI illustrates the expression builder. To do so, click Configure > Mapping > select a mapping > Association > Association Rules. Edit either link qualifier. You will see how the expression builder is configured for this sample.


[#multiaccount-roles-update]
=== Update Roles With Desired LDAP Attributes

This use case illustrates how accounts frequently have different functions on target systems. For example, while agents may be members of a Contractor group, insured customers may be part of a Chat Users group (possibly for access to customer service).

While an `agent` may also be an insured customer, you do not want other `insured` accounts to have the same properties (or memberships) as the `agent` account. In this sample, we ensure that OpenIDM limits role based assignments to the correct account.

With the following commands you will create two managed assignments which will be used by the `agent` and `insured` roles.

Record the `_id` number for each user. You will use those numbers to assign desired roles for each user.

The following command will create an `agent` assignment.

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
  --cacert self-signed.crt \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
  --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{
    "name" : "ldapAgent",
    "description" : "LDAP Agent Assignment",
    "mapping" : "managedUser_systemLdapAccounts",
    "attributes": [
      {
        "name": "ldapGroups",
        "value": [
          "cn=Contractors,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        ],
        "assignmentOperation" : "mergeWithTarget",
        "unassignmentOperation" : "removeFromTarget"
      }
    ],
    "linkQualifiers": ["agent"]
  }' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/assignment?_action=create"
----
Now repeat the process for the `insured` assignment, with the value set to the `Chat Users` group:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
  --cacert self-signed.crt \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
  --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{
    "name" : "ldapCustomer",
    "description" : "LDAP Customer Assignment",
    "mapping" : "managedUser_systemLdapAccounts",
    "attributes": [
      {
        "name": "ldapGroups",
        "value": [
          "cn=Chat Users,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        ],
        "assignmentOperation" : "mergeWithTarget",
        "unassignmentOperation" : "removeFromTarget"
      }
    ],
    "linkQualifiers": ["insured"]
  }' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/assignment?_action=create"
----
Now you can add the created assignments to their respective roles.

Add the `insured` assignment to the insured customer role:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "If-Match: *" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[
    {
      "operation" : "add",
      "field" : "/assignments/-",
      "value" : {
        "_ref" : "managed/assignment/ee5241b2-e571-4736-8fb2-6b9caa9d0554"
      }
    }
  ]' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/role/287dc4b1-4b19-49ec-8b4c-28a6c12ede34"
----
Add the `agent` assignment to the `agent` role:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "If-Match: *" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[
    {
      "operation" : "add",
      "field" : "/assignments/-",
      "value" : {
        "_ref" : "managed/assignment/12927c5d-576f-491e-ba65-e228cd218947"
      }
    }
  ]' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/role/bb9302c4-5fc1-462c-8be2-b17c87175d1b"
----


[#multiaccountlinking-recon]
=== Reconciling Managed Users to the External LDAP Server

Now that you have loaded `Example.ldif` into OpenDJ, and have started OpenIDM, you can perform a reconciliation from the internal Managed Users repository to the external OpenDJ data store:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
 --cacert self-signed.crt \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request POST \
 "https://localhost:8443/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=managedUser_systemLdapAccounts"
----
With all of the preparation work that you have done, this reconciliation will create three new accounts on the external LDAP server:

* `ou=Customers,dc=example,dc=com`+
`dn`+
`bjensen`+
`jdoe`
* `ou=Contractors,dc=example,dc=com`+
`dn`+
`jdoe`
Congratulations, you have just created accounts in two different areas of the LDAP Directory Information Tree.


[#multilinking-review]
=== Reviewing the Result

You have already confirmed that user `bjensen` has a `insured` role, and user `jdoe` has both a `insured` and `agent` role. You can confirm the same result in the Admin UI:

. 
. `jdoe`
. `bjensen`+
`jdoe`
