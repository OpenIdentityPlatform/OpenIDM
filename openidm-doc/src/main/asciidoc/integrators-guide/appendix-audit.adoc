[appendix]
[#appendix-audit]
== Additional Audit Details

From OpenIDM 4.5.1-20 onwards, the audit service supports audit event handlers that connect to third-party tools. As described in xref:chap-auditing.adoc#configuring-topic-handlers["Configuring Audit Event Handlers"], an audit event handler manages audit events, sends audit output to a defined location, and controls their format.

As we do not endorse or support the use of any third-party tools, we present the handlers for such tools in this separate appendix. For the purpose of this appendix, we assume that the third-party tool is configured on the same system as your instance of OpenIDM. We realize that you may prefer to set up a third-party tool on a remote system.

If you have configured a third-party tool on a remote system, the reliability of audit data may vary, depending on the reliability of your network connection. However, you can limit the risks with appropriate buffer settings, which can mitigate issues related to your network connection, free space on your system, and related resources such as RAM. (This is not an exhaustive list.)

[#appendix-elastic]
=== Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler

Starting with OpenIDM 4.5.0, you can configure the Elasticsearch audit event handler. It allows you to log OpenIDM events in file formats compatible with the Elasticsearch search server.

[#elastic-install]
==== Installing and Configuring Elasticsearch

This appendix assumes that you are installing Elasticsearch on the same system as OpenIDM. For Elasticsearch downloads and installation instructions, see the Elasticsearch link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html[Getting Started, window=\_blank] document.

You can set up Elasticsearch Shield with basic authentication to help protect your audit logs. To do so, read the following Elasticsearch document on link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/shield/current/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Shield, window=\_blank]. Follow up with the following Elasticsearch document on how you can link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/shield/current/enable-basic-auth.html[Control Access with Basic Authentication, window=\_blank].

You can configure SSL for Elasticsearch Shield. For more information, see the following Elasticsearch document: link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/shield/current/ssl-tls.html[Setting Up SSL/TLS on a Cluster, window=\_blank].

Import the certificate that you use for Elasticsearch into OpenIDM's truststore, with the following command:

[source, console]
----
$ keytool \
-import \
-trustcacerts \
-alias elasticsearch \
-file /path/to/cacert.pem \
-keystore /path/to/openidm/security/truststore
----
Once imported, you can activate the `useSSL` option in the `audit.json` file. If you created an Elasticsearch Shield username and password, you can also associate that information with the `username` and `password` entries in that same `audit.json` file.


[#elastic-audit-index]
==== Creating an Audit Index for Elasticsearch

If you want to create an audit index for Elasticsearch, you must set it up __before__ starting OpenIDM, for the audit event topics described in this section: xref:chap-auditing.adoc#default-audit-topics["OpenIDM Audit Event Topics"].

To do so, execute the REST call shown in the following link:../attachments/audit-index.sh[audit index, window=\_blank] file. Note the properties that are `not_analyzed`. Such fields are not indexed within Elasticsearch.

The REST call in the audit index file includes the following URL:

[source, console]
----
http://myUsername:myPassword@localhost:9200/audit
----
That URL assumes that your Elasticsearch deployment is on the localhost system, accessible on default port 9200, configured with an `indexName` of `audit`.

It also assumes that you have configured basic authentication on Elasticsearch Shield, with a username of `myUsername` and a password of `myPassword`.

If any part of your Elasticsearch deployment is different, revise the URL accordingly.

[WARNING]
====
Do not transmit usernames and passwords over an insecure connection. Enable the `useSSL` option, as described in xref:#elastic-config["Configuring the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler"].
====


[#elastic-config]
==== Configuring the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler

xref:#elastic-config-ui["Configuring the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler via the Admin UI"] and xref:#elastic-config-file["Configuring the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler in audit.json"] illustrate how you can configure the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler.

If you activate the Elasticsearch audit event handler, we recommend that you enable buffering for optimal performance, by setting:

[source, javascript]
----
"enabled" : true,
----
The `buffering` settings shown are not recommendations for any specific environment. If performance and audit data integrity are important in your environment, you may need to adjust these numbers.

If you choose to protect your Elasticsearch deployment with the plugin known as link:https://www.elastic.co/products/shield[Shield, window=\_blank], and configure the ability to link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/shield/current/enable-basic-auth.html[Control Access with Basic Authentication, window=\_blank], you can substitute your Elasticsearch Shield `admin` or `power_user` credentials for `myUsername` and `myPassword`.

If you activate the `useSSL` option, install the SSL certificate that you use for Elasticsearch into the OpenIDM keystore. For more information, see the following section: xref:chap-security.adoc#security-management-service["Accessing the Security Management Service"].

[#elastic-config-ui]
===== Configuring the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler via the Admin UI

To configure this event handler through the Admin UI, click Configure > System Preferences > Audit. Select `ElasticsearchAuditEventHandler` from the drop-down text box, click Add Event Handler, and configure it in the window that appears.

image::images/elastic-audit.png[]
For a list of properties, see xref:#audit-event-prop["Common Audit Event Handler Property Configuration"].


[#elastic-config-file]
===== Configuring the Elasticsearch Audit Event Handler in audit.json

Alternatively, you can configure the Elasticsearch audit event handler in the `audit.json` file for your project.

The following code is an excerpt from the `audit.json` file, with Elasticsearch configured as the handler for audit queries:

[source, javascript]
----
{
   "auditServiceConfig" : {
      "handlerForQueries" : "elasticsearch",
      "availableAuditEventHandlers" : [
         "org.forgerock.audit.handlers.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchAuditEventHandler",
         "org.forgerock.audit.handlers.csv.CsvAuditEventHandler",
         "org.forgerock.openidm.audit.impl.RepositoryAuditEventHandler",
         "org.forgerock.openidm.audit.impl.RouterAuditEventHandler"
      ],
----
You should also set up configuration for the Elasticsearch event handler. The entries shown are defaults, and can be configured. In fact, if you have set up Elasticsearch Shield, with or without SSL/TLS, as described in xref:#elastic-install["Installing and Configuring Elasticsearch"], you should change some of these defaults.

[source, javascript]
----
"eventHandlers" : [
   {
      "name" : "elasticsearch"
      "class" : "org.forgerock.audit.handlers.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchAuditEventHandler",
      "config" : {
         "connection" : {
            "useSSL" : false,
            "host" : "localhost",
            "port" : "9200"
         },
         "indexMapping" : {
            "indexName" : "audit"
         },
         "buffering" : {
            "enabled" : false,
            "maxSize" : 20000,
            "writeInterval" : "1 second",
            "maxBatchedEvents" : "500"
         }
         "topics" : [
            "access",
            "activity",
            "recon",
            "sync",
            "authentication",
            "config"
         ]
      }
   }
],
----
If you set `useSSL` to true, add the following properties to the `connection` code block:

[source, javascript]
----
"username" : "myUsername",
    "password" : "myPassword",
----
For more information on the other options shown in `audit.json`, see xref:#audit-event-prop["Common Audit Event Handler Property Configuration"].



[#elastic-verify-data]
==== Querying and Reading Elasticsearch Audit Events

By default, Elasticsearch uses pagination. As noted in the following Elasticsearch document on link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/pagination.html[Pagination, window=\_blank], queries are limited to the first 10 results.

For example, the following query is limited to the first 10 results:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request GET \
"http://localhost:8080/openidm/audit/access?_queryFilter=true"
----
To override the limit of 10 results, follow the guidance shown in xref:chap-data.adoc#paging-query-results["Paging and Counting Query Results"] for `pageSize`.

To set up a `queryFilter` that uses a "starts with" `sw` or "equals" `eq` comparison expression, you will need to set it up as a `not_analyzed` string field, as described in the following Elasticsearch document on link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html[Term Query., window=\_blank]. You should also review the section on xref:chap-data.adoc#query-comp-expression["Comparison Expressions"]. If you haven't already done so, you may need to modify and rerun the REST call described in xref:#elastic-audit-index["Creating an Audit Index for Elasticsearch"].

The `queryFilter` output should include UUIDs as `id` values for each audit event. To read audit data for that event, include that UUID in the URL. For example, the following REST call specifies an access event, which includes data on the client:

[source, console]
----
$ curl \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request GET
"http://localhost:8080/openidm/audit/access/75ca07f5-836c-4e7b-beaa-ae968325a529-622"
----



[#appendix-audit-schema]
=== Audit Configuration Schema

The following tables depict schema for the six audit event topics used by OpenIDM. Each topic is associated with the following files that you can find in the `openidm/audit` directory:

* `access.csv`: see xref:#access-event-prop["Access Event Topic Properties"]

* `activity.csv`: see xref:#activity-event-prop["Activity Event Topic Properties"]

* `authentication.csv`: see xref:#auth-event-prop["Authentication Event Topic Properties"]

* `config.csv`: see xref:#config-event-prop["Configuration Event Topic Properties"]

* `recon.csv`: see xref:#recon-event-prop["Reconciliation Event Topic Properties"]

* `sync.csv`: see xref:#sync-event-prop["Synchronization Event Topic Properties"]

If you open the CSV files from that directory in a spreadsheet application, those files can help you read through the tables shown in this appendix.

[#section-audit-event-config]
=== Audit Event Handler Configuration

When you set up an audit event handler, you can configure several properties. Most of the properties in the following table are used by the CSV audit event handler, and may be configured in the audit configuration file for your project: `project-dir/conf/audit.json`.

In several cases, the following table does not include an entry for `description`, as the UI Label / Text is sufficient.

If you're reviewing this from the OpenIDM Admin UI, click Configure > System Preferences > Audit, and click the edit icon associated with your event handler.

The tables shown in this section reflect the order in which properties are shown in the Admin UI. That order differs when you review the properties in your project's `audit.json` file.
