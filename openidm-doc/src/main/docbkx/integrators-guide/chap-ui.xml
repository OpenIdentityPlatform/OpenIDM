 <title>OpenIDM Web-based User Interfaces</title>

 <para>
  OpenIDM provides a customizable, browser-based user interface, known as the
  Data Management UI. The Data Management UI provides a graphical view of the
  OpenIDM <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="integrators-guide#managed-objects"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Managed
  Objects</citetitle></link> under <literal>managed/user</literal>. Most of the
  <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#chap-samples"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>OpenIDM
  Samples</citetitle></link> demonstrate how you can deploy OpenIDM with managed
  users.
 </para>

 <para>
  The Data Management UI enables administrative users to create, modify, and
  delete user and other accounts. It also provides role-based access to
  tasks based on BPMN2 workflows, and allows users to manage certain aspects of
  their own accounts, including configurable self-service registration. When
  OpenIDM starts, you can access the Data Management UI at
  <literal>https://localhost:8443/openidmui</literal>.
 </para>

 <para>
  OpenIDM also provides a configurable administrative user interface (Admin UI)
  that allows you to configure connectors, customize managed objects, set up
  attribute mappings, and more. When OpenIDM starts, you can access the Admin UI
  at <literal>https://localhost:8443/admin</literal>.
 </para>

 <para>
  The first time you log into either UI as the <literal>openidm-admin</literal>
  administrative user, the default password is <literal>openidm-admin</literal>.
  As that default password is not secure, we recommend that you change that
  password in production. However, you can bypass that window, by clicking the
  X in the upper right corner.

  <title>Configuring OpenIDM from the Admin UI</title>

  <para>
   You can set up a basic configuration for OpenIDM with the Administrative User
   Interface (Admin UI).
  </para>

  <para>
   Through the Admin UI, you can connect to resources, configure attribute
   mapping, and set up managed objects, reconciled on a defined schedule.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can customize the configuration of connectors, managed objects,
   mapping between resources, and more. You can add and edit properties to be
   synchronized, configure correlation queries, set up correlation scripts,
   and enable LiveSync.
  </para>

  <para>
   To access the initial Admin UI screen, navigate to
   <literal>https://localhost:8443/admin</literal>.

    <imagedata fileref="images/admin-ui-main.png" format="PNG" />
   </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>

  <para>
   The information that appears in the initial Admin UI screen depends on how
   you started OpenIDM. For example, if you start OpenIDM with one of the
   <link xlink:role="http://docbook.org/role/xlink/olink" xlink:show="new"
         xlink:href="install-guide#more-samples">OpenIDM Samples</link>, your
   first Resources screen will display connectors and managed objects as
   configured in the selected sample.
  </para>

  <para>
   As shown in the initial screen, the Admin UI supports: <link
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-resource-conf" xlink:show="new">
   Connecting to External Resources</link> and

   Groups, and Roles</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Scroll up and down the Admin UI screen. Review configured
   connectors and managed objects. The screenshots in this section assume that
   you have started OpenIDM with the
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
         xlink:href="install-guide#full-stack-sample">
   <citetitle>Full Stack Sample</citetitle></link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Connectors facilitate communication between OpenIDM and a remote resource,
   such as a database, an identity store, or another organized data store. The
   Admin UI uses the term <emphasis>connector</emphasis> to refer to the remote
   resource to which you are connecting. When you have connected two resources,
   you can create a mapping between the objects that are stored in those
   resources. Mapping the individual object properties enables synchronization
   between the resources.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    To edit a configured connector or managed object in the Admin UI, click on
    it. To delete either a connector or managed object, click the icon in the
    upper right of the box, and select Delete from the pop-up menu that appears.
   </para>
  </note>

  <section xml:id="ui-admin-connectors">
   <title>Administering Connectors from the UI</title>

   <para>
    You can include several different connectors in an OpenIDM configuration.
    Select the option to create a new connector. Try some of the different
    connector types in the screen that appears. Observe as the Admin UI changes
    the configuration options to match the requirements of the connector type.

  <section xml:id="admin-ui-resource-mapping">
   <title>Configuring a Resource Mapping from the UI</title>

   <para>
    Your deployment might include multiple external systems that you need to
    connect, either to each other, or to the OpenIDM managed object repository.
    You can use the Admin UI to configure mappings between any two sets of
    resources. In the Admin UI terminology, a <emphasis>connector</emphasis>
    represents an external data store. The connectors that are supported for use
    with OpenIDM are described in
    <link xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
    xlink:show="new" xlink:href="integrators-guide#openicf-provisioner-conf">
    <citetitle>Connectors Supported with OpenIDM</citetitle></link>. Managed
    objects represents the data repository that is internal to OpenIDM.
   </para>

   <para>
    Resource mapping requires a source and a target. Generally, a resource
    contains user accounts, which include properties such as username, address,
    surname, and title. Resources can contain other types of data, however,
    such as groups, or devices.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a source object is mapped to a target object, during a reconciliation
    operation, a <emphasis>link</emphasis> is created between the two objects.
    In some cases, there might be multiple target objects that map to a single
    source object. When there are multiple target objects, OpenIDM uses
    <emphasis>link qualifiers</emphasis> to distinguish between the types of
    relationships that are created from source to target. For more information,
    see <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="integrators-guide#correlating-multiple-targets"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Correlating
    Multiple Target Objects</citetitle></link>.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can create and remove link qualifiers on this screen, and use them when
    you define correlation queries, set up correlation scripts, or use
    transformation scripts to set the attribute values on target systems. The
    link qualifiers that you create here are added to your mapping
    (<filename>conf/sync.json</filename>) file. For more information about link
    qualifiers, see <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="integrators-guide#mapping-link-qualifiers"

    Qualifiers in a Mapping</citetitle></link>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you create a mapping between two resources, you identify the properties
    whose values you want to control in the target. The Attributes panel on this
    screen enables you to configure how OpenIDM matches properties in the source
    resource to properties in the target resource.
   </para>
   <para>
    The following screenshot illustrates a property mapping between two
    resources. Every resource includes identifiers for each attribute. For
    example, different resources might use one of the following identifiers for
    usernames: un, uid, user, sAMAccountName, and account. For more information
    on property mappings, see <link xlink:show="new"

   <title>Configuring Reconciliation from the UI</title>

   <para>
    Reconciliation changes data on a target system to match the corresponding
    data on a source system. You can customize how OpenIDM performs
    reconciliation in several ways.
   </para>

   <section xml:id="admin-ui-correlation">
    <title>Association Options</title>

    <para>
     If you are reconciling objects in a source system, with
     <emphasis>existing</emphasis> objects in a target system, OpenIDM uses
     <emphasis>correlation</emphasis> to determine whether the objects on the
     target system match the objects on the source system. Correlation involves
     writing a query to specify how OpenIDM should attempt to match the existing
     records.
    </para>
    <para>
     The Association tab in the UI enables you to create correlation queries, or
     set up correlation scripts, and to associate source and target objects
     manually.
    </para>
    <para>
     Before you define a correlation query, you must specify at least one link
     qualifier on the <emphasis>Properties</emphasis> panel (as described in the
     previous section). To configure a correlation query for a mapping you can
     use the Expression Builder.

     Existing Target Objects</citetitle></link>. If there is more than one
     potential target object that should be linked to each source object, use
     the Link Qualifier field to indicate how OpenIDM should create links to
     each target object. For more information about mapping to multiple

    </para>
    <para>
     When a reconciliation operation finds a matching target entry, the process
     creates a link between the source and the target entries. This is also known
     as a Data Association. Data associations serve two purposes - they speed up
     future reconciliation operations, and they serve as a record of the
     relationship between a source and a target entry.
    </para>

    <para>
     The association rules that are configured in the previous section enable
     automatic linking of source and target objects, in accordance with a set of
     defined criteria. These rules might not always link the correct target
     objects to the corresponding source objects. In this case, the Data
     Association Management panel enables you to manipulate links between
     individual source and target objects, manually. You must have run at least
     one reconciliation for any data to appear here. When a reconciliation has
     been run, select the source object that has been incorrectly mapped and
     select Change Source to Target Association, to specify the correct target
     object that should be linked to that source object.

     Before activating reconciliation, look at the options under the Behaviors
     tab. You can use these options to configure situational policies,
     action scripts dependent on situational events, and reconciliation scripts.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <para>
       You can configure situational policies. For new mappings, the default
       policy is "read-only". As such, OpenIDM does not change anything on the
       target system.
      </para>
      <para>
       With situational policies, you can define different actions as shown in
       the screenshot below. For a full list of available
       policies, see the following section:

     Finally, you should set up a schedule, as described in

     You can also configure LiveSync, which captures the changes that happen on
     a remote system, and then pushes those changes to OpenIDM.

    <para>
     While Reconciliation and LiveSync are two different concepts, you can
     manage both with the embedded Quartz scheduler. For more information, see
     the following section:

    </para>

    <para>
     Once you've set up Reconciliation based on configured properties,
     correlation queries or correlation scripts, and a synchronization schedule,
     you can start the synchronization process. Try it out! You'll see the
     results in the target data store.
    </para>

    <para>
     Once you have taken the steps required to configure OpenIDM through the
     Admin UI, you can start the synchronization process from a source to a
     target. Once a synchronization is complete, you can review the results in
     this window.

  <para>
   The Data Management UI is integrated with the embedded Activiti worfklow
   engine, enabling users to interact with workflows. Available workflows are
   displayed under the Processes item on the Dashboard. In order for a workflow
   to be displayed here, the workflow definition file must be present in the
   <filename>openidm/workflow</filename> directory.
  </para>
  <para>
   A sample workflow integration with the Data Management UI is provided in

   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Sample Workflow -
   Provisioning User Accounts</citetitle></link>. Follow the steps in that
   sample for an understanding of how the workflow integration works.
  </para>
  <para>
   General access to workflow-related endpoints is based on the access rules
   defined in the <filename>script/access.js</filename> file. The configuration
   defined in the <filename>conf/process-access.json</filename> file determines
   who can invoke workflows. By default all users with the role
   <literal>openidm-authorized</literal> or <literal>openidm-admin</literal> can
   invoke any available workflow. The default

   <para>
    You can set up a new theme, primarily through the
    <filename>bootstrap.min.js</filename> file. As the default version of this

    you would copy a custom <filename>bootstrap.min.js</filename> file to
    the <filename>openidm/ui/extension/libs</filename> directory.

 <section xml:id="ui-external-password-reset">
  <title>Using an External System for Password Reset</title>
  <para>
   By default, the password reset mechanism is handled internally, in OpenIDM.
   You can reroute password reset in the event that a user has forgotten his
   password, by specifying an external URL to which password reset requests are
   sent. Note that this URL applies to the password reset link on the login page
   only, not to the security data change facility that is available after a user
   has logged in.
  </para>
  <para>
   To set an external URL to handle password reset, set the
   <literal>passwordResetLink</literal> parameter in the UI configuration file
   (<filename>conf/ui-configuration.json</filename>) file. The following example
   sets the <literal>passwordResetLink</literal> to
   <literal>https://accounts.example.com/account/reset-password</literal>.
  </para>
  <screen>passwordResetLink: "https://accounts.example.com/reset-password"</screen>
  <para>
   The <literal>passwordResetLink</literal> parameter takes either an empty
   string as a value (which indicates that no external link is used) or a full
   URL to the external system that handles password reset requests.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    External password reset and security questions for internal password reset
    are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if you set a value for the
    <literal>passwordResetLink</literal> parameter, users will not be prompted
    with any security questions, regardless of the setting of the
    <literal>securityQuestions</literal> parameter.
   </para>

 <section xml:id="ui-external-logout">
  <title>Providing a Logout URL to External Applications</title>
  <para>
   By default, a UI session is invalidated when a user clicks on the Log out
   link. In certain situations your external applications might require a
   distinct logout URL to which users can be routed, to terminate their UI
   session.
  </para>
  <para>
   The logout URL is <literal>#logout</literal>, appended to the UI URL, for
   example, <literal>https://localhost:8443/openidmui/index.html#logout/</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The logout URL effectively performs the same action as clicking on the Log
   out link of the UI.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="ui-path">
  <title>Changing the UI Path</title>
  <para>
   By default, the UI is registered at a specific URL
   (<literal><replaceable>context-root</replaceable>/openidmui</literal>). To
   override the default URL and specify your own path, edit the
   <filename>openidm/conf/ui.context-enduser.json</filename> file, setting the
   <literal>urlContextRoot</literal> property to the new URL. For example, to
   change the path to
   <literal><replaceable>context-root</replaceable>/exampleui</literal>, edit
   the file as follows:
  </para>
  <screen>"urlContextRoot" : "/exampleui",</screen>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="ui-disabling">
  <title>Disabling the UI</title>
  <para>
   The UI is packaged as a separate bundle that can be disabled in the
   configuration before server startup. To disable the registration of the UI
   servlet, edit the <filename>openidm/conf/ui.context-enduser.json</filename>
   file, setting the <literal>enabled</literal> property to false:
  </para>
  <screen>"enabled" : false,</screen>
