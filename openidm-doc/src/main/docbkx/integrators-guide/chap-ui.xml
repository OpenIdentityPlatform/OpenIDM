 <title>OpenIDM User Interface</title>

 <para>OpenIDM provides a customizable, browser-based user interface. The 
 default user interface enables administrative users to create, modify and 
 delete user accounts. It provides role-based access to tasks based on BPMN2 
 workflows, and allows users to manage certain aspects of their own accounts, 
 including configurable self-service registration.</para>

<section xml:id="ui-overview">
  <title>Overview of the Default User Interface</title>
  
  <para>The default user interface is provided as a reference implementation 
  that demonstrates the capabilities of the REST API. You can modify certain 
  aspects of the default user interface according to the requirements of your 
  deployment. Note, however, that the default user interface is still evolving 
  and is not guaranteed to be compatible with the next OpenIDM release.</para>

  <para>To access the user interface, install and start OpenIDM, then point 
  your browser to <link xlink:href="http://localhost:8080/openidmui">
  http://localhost:8080/openidmui</link>.</para>
  
  <para>Log in as the default administrative user (Login: openidm-admin, 
  Password: openidm-admin) or as an existing user in the repository. The 
  display differs, depending on the role of the user that has logged in.</para>
  
  <para>For an administrative user (role <literal>openidm-admin</literal>), 
  two tabs are displayed - Dashboard and Users. The Dashboard tab lists any 
  tasks assigned to the user, processes available to be invoked, and any 
  notifications for that user. The Users tab provides an interface to manage 
  user entries (OpenIDM managed objects under <literal>managed/user</literal>).</para>

   </imageobject>
</mediaobject>
  
  <para>The <literal>Profile</literal> link enables the user to modify elements 
  of his user data. The <literal>Change Security Data</literal> link enables 
  the user to change his password and, optionally, to select a new security 
  question.</para>

  <para>For a regular user (role <literal>openidm-authorized</literal>), the 
  Users tab is not displayed - so regular users cannot manage user accounts, 
  except for certain aspects of their own accounts.</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="ui-configuring">
  <title>Configuring the Default User Interface</title>
    
  <para>The following sections outline the configurable aspects of the default 
  user interface.</para>
  
  <section xml:id="ui-self-registration">
    <title>Enabling Self-Registration</title>
  
    <para>Self-registration (the ability for new users to create their own 
    accounts) is disabled by default. To enable self-registration, set 
    <literal>"selfRegistration"</literal> to <literal>true</literal> in 
    the <filename>conf/ui-configuration.json</filename> file.</para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "configuration" : {
        "selfRegistration" : true,
...    
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>With <literal>"selfRegistration" : true</literal>, the following 
    capabilities are provided on the right-hand pane of the user interface:
    </para>
    
    <simplelist>
      <member>Register my account</member>
      <member>Reset my password</member>
    </simplelist>
    
    <para>User objects created using self-registration automatically have the 
    role <literal>openidm-authorized</literal>.</para>

  </section>
  
   <section xml:id="ui-security-questions">
    <title>Configuring Security Questions</title>
  
    <para>Security questions are disabled by default. To guard against 
    unauthorized access, you can specify that users be prompted with security 
    questions if they request a password reset. A default set of questions is 
    provided, but you can add to these, or overwrite them. 
    To enable security questions, set <literal>"securityQuestions"</literal> 
    to <literal>true</literal> in the 
    <filename>conf/ui-configuration.json</filename> file.</para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "configuration" : {
        "securityQuestions" : true,
...    
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>Specify the list of questions to be asked in the 
    <filename>conf/ui-secquestions.json</filename> file.</para>
    
    <para>Refresh your browser after this configuration change for the change 
    to be picked up by the UI.</para>    
  </section>
  
  <section xml:id="ui-site-identification">
    <title>Enabling Site Identification</title>
    
    <para>To ensure that users are entering their details onto the correct 
    site, you can enable site identification. Site identification provides a 
    preventative measure against phishing.
    </para>
    
    <para>With site identification enabled, users are presented with a range of 
    images from which they can select. To enable site identification, set 
    <literal>"siteIdentification"</literal> to <literal>true</literal> 
    in the <filename>conf/ui-configuration.json</filename> file.</para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">
{
    "configuration" : {
        "siteIdentification" : true,
...    
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>Refresh your browser after this configuration change for the change 
    to be picked up by the UI.</para>    
    
    <para>A default list of four images is presented for site identification.
    </para>
    <!-- Failing to get this next bit to work 
    You can change these images, and include additional images, by modifying 
    the <literal>siteImages</literal> property in the 
    <filename>ui-configuration.json</filename> file:</para>
    
    <programlisting language="javascript">
            "siteImages" : [
            "mail.png",
            "user.png",
            "report.png",
            "twitter.png"
        ],
...    
    </programlisting> 
    -->
    <para>
    The user selects one of these images, which is displayed on login. In 
    addition, the user enters a Site Phrase, which is displayed beneath the 
    site image on login. If either the site image, or site phrase is incorrect 
    or absent when the user logs in, the user is aware that he is not logging 
    in to the correct site.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section xml:id="ui-country-list">
    <title>Configuring the Country List</title>
    
    <para>The default user profile includes the ability to specify the user's 
    country and state or province. To specify the countries that appear in 
    this drop down list, and their associated states or provinces, edit the 
    <filename>conf/ui-countries.json</filename> file. For example, to add 
    Norway to the list of countries, you would add the following to the 
    <filename>conf/ui-countries.json</filename> file:</para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">
        {
            "key" : "norway",
            "value" : "Norway",
            "states" : [
                {
                    "key" : "akershus",
                    "value" : "Akershus"
                },
                {
                    "key" : "aust-agder",
                    "value" : "Aust-Agder"
                },
                {
                    "key" : "buskerud",
                    "value" : "Buskerud"
                },
...
    </programlisting>

     <para>Most of these fields are self-explanatory. Be aware that the user 
     interface is subject to policy validation, as described in <link 
     xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-policies" 
     xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">
     <citetitle>Using Policies to Validate Data</citetitle></link>. So, for 
     example, the Email address must be of valid email address format, and 
     the Password must comply with the password validation settings that are 
     indicated in the panel to the right.</para>
     <para>The Admin Role field reflects the roles that are defined in the 
     <filename>ui-configuration.json</filename> file. The roles are mapped as

<section xml:id="ui-managing-workflows">
  <title>Managing Workflows From the User Interface</title>
  
  <para>The user interface is integrated with the embedded Activiti worfklow 
  engine, enabling users to interact with workflows. Available workflows are 
  displayed under the Processes item on the Dashboard. In order for a workflow 
  to be displayed here, the workflow definition file must be present in the 
  <filename>openidm/workflow</filename> directory.</para>
  
  <para>A sample workflow integration with the user interface is provided in 
  <filename>openidm/samples/workflow</filename>, and documented in <link

  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Sample Workflow - 
  Provisioning User Accounts</citetitle></link>. Follow the steps in that 
  sample for an understanding of how the workflow integration works.</para>
  
  <para>Access to workflows is based on OpenIDM roles, and is configured in 
  the file <filename>conf/process-access.json</filename>. By default all users 
  with the role <literal>openidm-authorized</literal> or 
  <literal>openidm-admin</literal> can invoke any available workflow. The 
  default <filename>process-access.json</filename> file is as follows:</para>
