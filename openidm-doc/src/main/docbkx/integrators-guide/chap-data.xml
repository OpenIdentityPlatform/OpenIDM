 <title>Accessing Data Objects</title>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Data</primary>
  <secondary>accessing</secondary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>
  OpenIDM supports a variety of objects that can be addressed via a URL or URI.
  You can access data objects by using scripts (through the Resource API) or by
  using direct HTTP calls (through the REST API).
 </para>
 <para>
  The following sections describe these two methods of accessing data objects,
  and provide information on constructing and calling data queries.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="data-scripts">
  <title>Accessing Data Objects by Using Scripts</title>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Objects</primary>
   <secondary>Script access</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   OpenIDM's uniform programming model means that all objects are queried and
   manipulated in the same way, using the Resource API. The URL or URI that is
   used to identify the target object for an operation depends on the object
   type. For an explanation of object types, see the
   <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#appendix-objects"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Data Models and
   Objects Reference</citetitle></link>. For more information about scripts and
   the objects available to scripts, see the
   <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#appendix-scripting"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Scripting
   Reference</citetitle></link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can use the Resource API to obtain managed objects, configuration
   objects, and repository objects, as follows:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="javascript">
val = openidm.read("managed/organization/mysampleorg")
val = openidm.read("config/custom/mylookuptable")
val = openidm.read("repo/custom/mylookuptable")</programlisting>

  <para>
   For information about constructing an object ID, see <link
   xlink:href="integrators-guide#rest-uri-scheme"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>URI Scheme</citetitle></link>
   in the <citetitle>REST API Reference</citetitle>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can update entire objects with the <literal>update()</literal> function,
   as follows.
  </para>

  <programlisting language="javascript">
openidm.update("managed/organization/mysampleorg", mymap)
openidm.update("config/custom/mylookuptable", mymap)
openidm.update("repo/custom/mylookuptable", mymap)</programlisting>

  <para>
   For managed objects, you can partially update an object with the
   <literal>patch()</literal> function.
  </para>

  <programlisting language="javascript">
openidm.patch("managed/organization/mysampleorg", rev, value)</programlisting>

  <para>
   The <literal>create()</literal>, <literal>delete()</literal>, and
   <literal>query()</literal> functions work the same way.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="data-rest">
  <title>Accessing Data Objects by Using the REST API</title>

  <para>
   OpenIDM provides RESTful access to data objects via a REST API. To access
   objects over REST, you can use a browser-based REST client, such as the
   <link xlink:href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb">
   Simple REST Client</link> for Chrome, or <link
  xlink:href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/">
   RESTClient</link> for Firefox. Alternatively you can use the <link
  xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://curl.haxx.se/"><command>curl</command>
   </link> command-line utility.
  </para>

  <para>
   For a comprehensive overview of the REST API, see the <link
  xlink:href="integrators-guide#appendix-rest"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>REST API
   Reference</citetitle></link> appendix.
  </para>

  <para>
   To obtain a managed object through the REST API, depending on your security
   settings and authentication configuration, perform an HTTP GET on the
   corresponding URL, for example
   <literal>https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/organization/mysampleorg</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   By default, the HTTP GET returns a JSON representation of the object.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="queries">
  <title>Defining and Calling Queries</title>
  <para>
   OpenIDM supports an advanced query model that enables you to define queries,
   and to call them over the REST or Resource API. Three types of queries are
   supported, on both managed, and system objects:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Common filter expressions
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Parameterized, or predefined queries
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Native query expressions
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   Each of these mechanisms is discussed in the following sections.
  </para>

  <section xml:id="query-filters">
   <title>Common Filter Expressions</title>
   <para>
    The ForgeRock REST API defines common filter expressions, that enable you to
    form arbitrary queries using a number of supported filter operations. This
    query capability is the standard way to query data if no predefined query
    exists, and is supported for all managed and system objects.
   </para>
   <para>
    Common filter expressions are useful in that they do not require knowledge
    of how the object is stored and do not require additions to the repository
    configuration.
   </para>
   <para>
    Common filter expressions are called with the
    <literal>_queryFilter</literal> keyword. The following example uses a common
    filter expression to retrieve managed user objects whose user name is Smith.
   </para>
   <screen>$ curl \
 --cacert self-signed.crt \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 "https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_queryFilter=userName%20eq%20%22smith%22"</screen>
   <para>
    The filter is URL encoded in this example. The corresponding filter using
    the resource API would be:
   </para>
   <screen>openidm.query("managed/user", { "_queryFilter" : '/userName eq "smith"' });</screen>
   <para>
    Note that, this JavaScript invocation is internal and is not subject to the
    same URL-encoding requirements that a GET request would be. Also, because
    JavaScript supports the use of single quotes, it is not necessary to escape
    the double quotes in this example.
   </para>
   <para>
    For a list of supported filter operations, see
    <xref linkend="constructing-queries" />.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that using common filter expressions to retrieve values from arrays is
    currently not supported. If you need to search within an array you should
    set up a predefined (parameterized) in your repository configuration. For
    more information, see <xref linkend="parameterized-queries" />.
   </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="parameterized-queries">
   <title>Parameterized Queries</title>
   <para>
    Managed objects in the supported OpenIDM repositories can be accessed using
    a parameterized query mechanism. Parameterized queries on repositories are
    defined in the repository configuration (<filename>repo.*.json</filename>)
    and are called by their <literal>_queryId</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Parameterized queries provide precise control over the query that is
    executed. Such control might be useful for tuning, or for performing
    database operations such as aggregation (which is not possible with a
    common filter expression.)
   </para>
   <para>
    Parameterized queries provide security and portability for the query call
    signature, regardless of the back-end implementation. Queries that are
    exposed over the REST interface <emphasis>must</emphasis> be parameterized
    queries to guard against injection attacks and other misuse. Queries on the
    officially supported repositories have been reviewed and hardened against
    injection attacks.
   </para>
   <para>
    For system objects, support for parameterized queries is restricted to
    <literal>_queryId=query-all-ids</literal>. There is currently no support for
    user-defined parameterized queries on system objects. Typically,
    parameterized queries on system objects are not called directly over the
    REST interface, but are issued from internal calls, such as correlation
    queries.
   </para>
   <para>
    A typical query definition is as follows:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
"query-all-ids" : "select _openidm_id from ${unquoted:_resource}"</programlisting>
   <para>
    To call this query, you would reference its ID, as follows:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
?_queryId=query-all-ids</programlisting>
   <para>
    The following example calls <literal>query-all-ids</literal> over the REST
    interface:
   </para>
   <screen>$ curl \
 --cacert self-signed.crt \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 "https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_queryId=query-all-ids"</screen>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="native-queries">
   <title>Native Query Expressions</title>
   <para>
    Native query expressions are supported for all managed objects and system
    objects, and can be called directly, rather than being defined in the
    repository configuration.
   </para>
   <para>
    Native queries are intended specifically for internal callers, such as
    custom scripts, and should be used only in situations where the common
    filter or parameterized query facilities are insufficient. For example,
    native queries are useful if the query needs to be generated dynamically.
   </para>
   <para>
    The query expression is specific to the target resource. For repositories,
    queries use the native language of the underlying data store. For system
    objects that are backed by OpenICF connectors, queries use the applicable
    query language of the system resource.
   </para>
   <para>
    Native queries on the repository are made using the
    <literal>_queryExpression</literal> keyword. For example:
   </para>
   <screen>$ curl \
 --cacert self-signed.crt \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 "https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_queryExpression=select+from+managed_user"</screen>
   <para>
    Unless you have specifically enabled native queries over REST, the previous
    command returns a 403 access denied error message. Native queries are not
    portable and do not guard against injection attacks. Such query expressions
    should therefore not be used or made accessible over the REST interface or
    over HTTP, in production environments. They should be used only via the
    internal Resource API. If you want to enable native queries over REST for
    development, see the section on
    <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#security-urls"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Protecting
    Sensitive REST Interface URLs</citetitle></link>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Alternatively, if you really need to expose native queries over HTTP, in a
    selective manner, you can design a custom endpoint to wrap such access.
   </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="constructing-queries">
   <title>Constructing Queries</title>
   <para>
    The <literal>openidm.query</literal> function enables you to query OpenIDM
    managed and system objects. The query syntax is
    <literal>openidm.query(id, params)</literal>, where <literal>id</literal>
    specifies the object on which the query should be performed and
    <literal>params</literal> provides the parameters that are passed to the
    query, either <literal>_queryFilter</literal> or
    <literal>_queryID</literal>. For example:
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
var params = {
    '_queryFilter' : 'givenName co "' + sourceCriteria + '" or ' + 'sn co "'
                     + sourceCriteria + '"'
};
var results = openidm.query("system/ScriptedSQL/account", params)</programlisting>

   <para>
    Over the REST interface, the query filter is specified as
    <literal>_queryFilter=<replaceable>filter</replaceable></literal>, for
    example:
   </para>
   <screen>$ <userinput>curl \
 --cacert self-signed.crt \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET
 'https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_queryFilter=userName+eq+"Smith"'</userinput></screen>
   <para>
    Note the use of double-quotes around the search term:
    <literal>Smith</literal>. In <literal>_queryFilter</literal>
    expressions, string values <emphasis>must</emphasis> use double-quotes.
    Numeric and boolean expressions should not use quotes.
   </para>
   <para>
    When called over REST, you must URL encode the filter expression. The
    following examples show the filter expressions using the resource API and
    the REST API, but do not show the URL encoding, to make them easier to read.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that, for generic mappings, any fields that are included in the query
    filter (for example <literal>userName</literal> in the previous query), must
    be explicitly defined as <emphasis>searchable</emphasis>, if you have set
    the global <literal>searchableDefault</literal> to false. For more
    information, see <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="integrators-guide#searches-with-generic-mappings"

    Search Performance for Generic Mappings</citetitle></link>.
   </para>
   <variablelist>
   <para>
    The <replaceable>filter</replaceable> expression is constructed from the
    building blocks shown in this section. In these expressions the simplest
    <replaceable>json-pointer</replaceable> is a field of the JSON resource,

       Literal expressions (<literal>true</literal> and

    Predefined queries also provide some support for paged
    results, useful, for example, for UI display purposes. Predefined queries
    must be configured to support paging, in the repository configuration. For
    example:
   </para>
   <screen>"query-all-ids" : "select _openidm_id from ${unquoted:_resource} SKIP ${unquoted:_pagedResultsOffset} LIMIT ${unquoted:_pageSize}",</screen>
   <para>
    This query configuration enables the paging parameters to be used, for
    example, in a query such as the following:

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>_pagedResultsCookie</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Opaque cookie used by the server to keep track of the position
       in the search results. The format of the cookie is a string value.
      </para>
      <para>
       The server provides the cookie value on the first request. You should then
       supply the cookie value in subsequent requests until the server returns a
       null cookie, meaning that the final page of results has been returned.
      </para>
      <para>
       Paged results are enabled only if the <literal>_pageSize</literal> is a
       non-zero integer.

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>_pagedResultsOffset</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specifies the index within the result set of the number of records to be
       skipped before the first result is returned. The format of the
       <literal>_pagedResultsOffset</literal> is an integer value. When the value
       of <literal>_pagedResultsOffset</literal> is greater than or equal to 1,
       the server returns pages, starting after the specified index.
      </para>
      <para>
       This request assumes that the <literal>_pageSize</literal> is set, and not
       equal to zero.
      </para>
      <para>
       For example, if the result set includes 10 records, the
       <literal>_pageSize</literal> is 2, and the
       <literal>_pagedResultsOffset</literal> is 6, the server skips the first 6
       records, then returns 2 records, 7 and 8. The
       <literal>_pagedResultsCookie</literal> value would then be 8 (the index of
       the last returned record) and the <literal>_remainingPagedResults</literal>
       value would be 2, the last two records (9 and 10) that have not yet been
       returned.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the offset points to a page beyond the last of the search results, the
       result set returned is empty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Note that the <literal>_remainingPagedResults</literal> parameter is not
       supported for all queries. Where it is not supported, the returned value
       is always <literal>-1</literal>.
      </para>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>_pageSize</literal></term>

       An optional parameter indicating that query results should be returned in

       The default behavior is not to return paged query results. If set, this
