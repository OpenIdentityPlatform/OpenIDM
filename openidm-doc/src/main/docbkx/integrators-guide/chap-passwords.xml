 <para>OpenIDM provides password management features that help you enforce
 password policies, limit the number of passwords users must remember, and
 let users reset and change their passwords.</para>

 <section xml:id="enforce-password-policy">
  <title>Enforcing Password Policy</title>

  <para>A password policy is a set of rules defining what sequence of
  characters constitutes an acceptable password. Acceptable passwords generally
  are too complex for users or automated programs to generate or guess.</para>

  <para>Password policies set requirements for password length, character sets
  that passwords must contain, dictionary words and other values that passwords
  must not contain. Password policies also require that users not reuse old
  passwords, and that users change their passwords on a regular basis.</para>

  <para>OpenIDM enforces password policy rules as part of the general policy 
  service. For more information about the policy service, see 
  <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-policies" 
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">
  <citetitle>Using Policies to Validate Data</citetitle></link>. The default 
  password policy applies the following rules to passwords as they are created 
  and updated:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>A password property is required for any user object.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><para>The value of a password cannot be empty.</para></listitem>

    <indexterm>
     <primary>Synchronization</primary>
     <secondary>Passwords</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>
     To minimize password reuse, you can set up a password history policy.
     One way to do so is with a custom javascript file for the
     <literal>onCreate</literal> trigger. You can then add a reference
     to that javascript file in the <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file.
    </para>

    <para>
     You would then add a scripted policy in a custom javascript file,
     ready to be called out in appropriate JSON configuration files.
    </para>

    <para>
     The following procedure retains a record of the last four passwords for
     each user. Any attempt to reuse one of those passwords is rejected.
    </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The location from which scripts are called is configured in the script
     configuration file (<filename>conf/script.json</filename>) For more
     information, see <link xlink:show="new"

    </para>
   </note>

   <procedure xml:id="create-password-array">
    <title>Configuring Limits on Password History</title>

    <step>
     <para>
      Create a custom <literal>onCreate</literal> javascript file. One
      way to do so is with a copy of the
      <filename>onCreate-user-set-default-fields.js</filename> file in the
      <filename>bin/defaults/script/ui</filename> directory.
      You can save the custom file in the
      <filename>script</filename> directory. For example,
      the following commands create an
      <filename>onCreate-user-custom.js</filename> file in the default
      script directory defined in <filename>conf/script.json</filename>:
     </para>
     <screen width="90">$ cd /path/to/openidm/bin/defaults/script/ui
$ cp onCreate-user-set-default-fields.js /path/to/openidm/script/onCreate-user-custom.js</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      In the newly created custom JavaScript file, include the cipher for
      password encryption:
     </para>
     <screen width="90">var cipher = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding",
     alias = identityServer.getProperty("openidm.config.crypto.alias", "true", true);</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      Next, declare a new
      <literal>lastPass</literal> attribute. For example, to prevent
      reuse of the last four passwords, you would add the following line:
     </para>
     <screen>object.lastPass = new Array(4);</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      After the new array is declared, the following lines would increment
      the previous password:
     </para>
     <screen>if (object.password) {
    object.lastPass.shift();
    object.lastPass.push(object.password);
}</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      Now create a new file with a script that increments passwords in the
      array with each new password. This procedure uses the following file name:
      <filename>onUpdate-user-pwpolicy.js</filename>, written to the same
      directory as the <filename>onCreate-user-custom.js</filename> file,
      in this case, <filename>script</filename>.
     </para>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      Add the following content to the newly created
      <filename>onUpdate-user-pwpolicy.js</filename> file:
     </para>
     <screen>/*global newObject, oldObject */
var cipher = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding",
  alias = identityServer.getProperty("openidm.config.crypto.alias", "true", true);

if (openidm.isEncrypted(newObject.lastPass)) {
  newObject.lastPass = openidm.decrypt(newObject.lastPass);
}

if (typeof newObject.lastPass === "undefined") {
  newObject.lastPass = new Array(4);
}

if (newObject.password !== oldObject.password) {
  newObject.lastPass.shift();
  newObject.lastPass.push(newObject.password);
}

newObject.lastPass = openidm.encrypt(newObject.lastPass, cipher, alias);
}</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      In the existing <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file, add
      appropriate lines that point to the files just created in the
      <filename>script</filename> directory. Given the
      default directories previously described in the <filename>
      conf/script.json</filename> file, you do not need to add a
      directory path to the newly created files. The following is
      an excerpt of the modified <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file:
     </para>
     <screen>{
      "objects" : [
           "name" : "user"
           "onCreate" : {
                "type" : "text/javascript",
                "file" : "onCreate-user-custom.js"
           },
           "onUpdate" : {
                "type" : "text/javascript",
                "file" : "onUpdate-user-pwpolicy.js"
           },
           "onDelete" : {
                "type" : "text/javascript",
                "file" : "ui/onDelete-user-cleanup.js"
           },</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      Now extend the policy service to all users by adding a scripted
      policy. One way to do so is by adding the following information to
      a custom javascript file. For this procedure, call that file
      <filename>pwpolicy.js</filename>, also in the <filename>script</filename>
      subdirectory.
     </para>
     <para>
      As you can see from the comments to the file, it is designed to ignore new
      users, users without a password history, and users for whom passwords
      have not changed.
     </para>
     <para>
      The last part of the file decrypts encrypted passwords prior to making
      the comparison, and makes sure the password has a non-zero length.
     </para>
     <screen width="90">/*global addPolicy, request, openidm */

addPolicy({
  "policyId" : "is-new",

  if (currentObject === null) {
    return [];
  }

  // don't try this policy is there is no history object available
  if (currentObject.lastPass === null || currentObject.lastPass === undefined) {
     return [];
  }

  if (currentObject[property] !== null &amp;&amp; currentObject[property] !== undefined &amp;&amp;
     openidm.isEncrypted(currentObject[property])) {
     currentObject[property] = openidm.decrypt(currentObject[property]);

  for(i=0; i &lt; lastPass.length; i++) {
    if (lastPass[i] === value) {
      return [{"policyRequirement": "IS_NEW"}];
    }
  }
  return [];

}</screen>
    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      Now open the <filename>conf/policy.json</filename> file. Add
      the following lines to call the newly created
      <filename>pwpolicy.js</filename> script, right after

      script:

     <para>
      Later in the same <filename>conf/policy.json</filename> file, in the

 </section>

 <section xml:id="password-sync">
  <title>Password Synchronization</title>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>Synchronization</primary>
   <secondary>Passwords</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Password synchronization intercepts user password changes, and ensures
   uniform password changes across resources that store the password. Following
   password synchronization, the user authenticates using the same password on
   each resource. No centralized directory or authentication server is required
   for performing authentication. Password synchronization reduces the number of
   passwords users need to remember, so they can use fewer, stronger passwords.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenIDM can propagate passwords to the resources that store a user's
   password, and can intercept and synchronize passwords that are changed
   natively in OpenDJ and Active Directory.
  </para>

  <para>
   When you use password synchronization, set up password policy enforcement on
   OpenDJ or Active Directory rather than on OpenIDM. Alternatively, ensure that
   all password policies that are enforced are identical to prevent password
   updates on one resource from being rejected by OpenIDM or by another
   resource.
  </para>

  <para>
   The password synchronization plugins intercept password changes on the
   resource before the passwords are stored in encrypted form. The plugins then
   send intercepted password values to OpenIDM over an encrypted channel.
  </para>

  <para>
   In the event that the OpenIDM instance is unavailable when a password is
   changed, the plugin intercepts the change, encrypts the password, and stores
   the encrypted password in a JSON file. The plugin then checks whether the
   OpenIDM instance is available, at a predefined interval. When OpenIDM becomes
   available, the plugin performs a PATCH on the user record, to replace the
   password with the encrypted password stored in the JSON file.
  </para>

  <para>
   To be able to synchronize the passwords, the plugin requires that the
   <literal>managed/user</literal> object exist in the OpenIDM repository. Users
   have typically been created by a reconciliation or liveSync process.
  </para>

  <para>
   The OpenDJ password sync plugin is supported for OpenDJ versions 2.4.6, 2.5,
   and 2.6. The Active Directory password sync plugin is supported on Windows
   2003, Windows 2008 R2, and Windows 2012 R2.

       The Password Sync Service uses Windows certificate stores to verify
       OpenIDM's identity. The certificate that OpenIDM uses must therefore
       be added to the list of trusted certificates on the Windows machine.
      </para>
      <para>
       For production purposes, you should use a certificate that has been
       issued by a certificate authority. For test purposes, you can use the
       self-signed certificate that is generated by OpenIDM on first startup.
      </para>
      <para>
       To add the OpenIDM certificate to the list of trusted certificates, use
       the Microsoft Management Console.

     To configure implicit synchronization, that is the password is updated in
     Active Directory automatically when it is changed in OpenIDM, you must
     complete the following three steps:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Define a mapping from <literal>managed/user</literal> to
       <literal>system/ad/account</literal> in your
       <filename>/path/to/openidm/conf/sync.json</filename> file.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify the <literal>{"source" : "password", "target" : "adPassword"}</literal>
       property as part of this mapping.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Make sure that implicit synchronization is enabled for that mapping. By
       default, all mappings participate in implicit synchronization operations
       so you should not have to enable this operation manually unless you have
       specifically set the <literal>"enableSync"</literal> property of the
       mapping to <literal>false</literal>.
