 <title>Managing the OpenIDM Repository</title>

 <para>
  OpenIDM stores managed objects, internal users, and configuration objects in
  a repository. By default, OpenIDM uses OrientDB for its internal repository.
  In production, you must replace OrientDB with a supported JDBC repository, as
  described in <link xlink:href="install-guide#chap-repository"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Installing a
  Repository For Production</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Installation
  Guide</citetitle>.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter describes the JDBC repository configuration, the use of mappings
  in the repository, and how to configure a connection to the repository over
  SSL. It also describes how to interact with the OpenIDM repository over the
  REST interface.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="jdbc-repo-config">
  <title>Understanding the JDBC Repository Configuration File</title>
  <para>
   OpenIDM provides a specific configuration file for each supported JDBC
   repository, as well as example configurations for other repositories. These
   configuration files are located in
   <filename>/path/to/openidm/db/<replaceable>database</replaceable></filename>
   and are named <filename>repo.jdbc.json</filename>. Copy the configuration
   file for your specific database type to
   <filename>/path/to/openidm/conf/</filename>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The repository configuration file includes the connection details for the
   repository, a number of predefined queries, and a mapping between OpenIDM
   resources and the tables in the repository.
  </para>

   An excerpt from an example repository configuration follows.

  <title>Using Explicit or Generic Object Mapping With a JDBC Repository</title>
  <itemizedlist>

    For JDBC repositories, there are two ways of mapping OpenIDM objects to the
    database tables.
   </para>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Generic mapping</emphasis>, which allows arbitrary objects to be
     stored without special configuration or administration.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Explicit mapping</emphasis>, which allows for optimized storage
     and queries by explicitly mapping objects to tables and columns in the
     database.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   These two mapping strategies are discussed in the following sections.
  </para>

  <section xml:id="generic-mappings">
   <title>Using Generic Mappings</title>
   <para>
    Generic mapping speeds up development, and can make system maintenance
    more flexible by providing a more stable database structure. However,
    generic mapping can have a performance impact and does not take full
    advantage of the database facilities (such as validation within the database
    and flexible indexing). In addition, queries can be more difficult to set up.
   </para>
   <para>
    In a generic table, the entire object content is stored in a single
    large-character field named <literal>"fullobject"</literal> in the
    <literal>"mainTable"</literal> for the object. To search on specific fields,
    you can read them by referring to them in the corresponding
    <literal>properties table</literal> for that object. The disadvantage of
    generic objects is that, because every property you might like to filter by
    is stored in a separate table, you must join to that table each time you need
    to filter by anything.
   </para>
   <para>
    The following diagram shows a pared down database structure for the default
    generic table, and indicates the relationship between the main table and
    the corresponding properties table for each object.

   </mediaobject>
   <para>
    These separate tables can make the query syntax particularly complex. For
    example, a simple query to return user entries based on a user name would
    need to be implemented as follows:
   </para>
   <programlisting width="100">
SELECT fullobject FROM ${_dbSchema}.${_mainTable} obj INNER JOIN ${_dbSchema}.${_propTable} prop
    ON obj.id = prop.${_mainTable}_id INNER JOIN ${_dbSchema}.objecttypes objtype
    ON objtype.id = obj.objecttypes_id WHERE prop.propkey='/userName' AND prop.propvalue = ${uid}
    AND objtype.objecttype = ${_resource}",
   </programlisting>
   <para>
    The query can be broken down as follows:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Select the full object from the main table</para>
     <programlisting>
SELECT fullobject FROM ${_dbSchema}.${_mainTable} obj

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Join to the object types table to restrict returned entries to objects of
      a specific type. For example, you might want to restrict returned entries
      to <literal>managed/user</literal> objects, or <literal>managed/role</literal>
      objects.

      userName is equal to the specified <literal>uid</literal> and the object
      type is the specified type (in this case, managed/user objects).
     </para>
     <programlisting>
WHERE prop.propkey='/userName'
AND prop.propvalue = ${uid}
AND objtype.objecttype = ${_resource}",
     </programlisting>
     <para>
      The value of the <literal>uid</literal> field is provided as part of the

      <para>
       Specifies whether all properties of the resource should be searchable by
       default. Properties that are searchable are stored and indexed. You can
       override the default for individual properties in the
       <literal>"properties"</literal> element of the mapping. The preceding

       of the <literal>"picture"</literal> property.
      </para>
      <para>
       For large, complex objects, having all properties searchable implies a
       substantial performance impact. In such a case, a separate insert
       statement is made in the properties table for each element in the object,
       every time the object is updated. Also, because these are indexed fields,
       the recreation of these properties incurs a cost in the maintenance of
       the index. You should therefore enable <literal>"searchable"</literal>
       only for those properties that must be used as part of a WHERE clause in
       a query.

       adding a new <literal>"searchable"</literal> property in the
       configuration, for example) will not cause the existing values to be
       updated in the properties table for that object. To add the new property
       to the properties table for that object, you must update or recreate the

   <title>Improving Search Performance for Generic Mappings</title>
   <para>
    By default, all properties in a generic mapping are searchable.
    Although there are no individual indexes in a generic mapping, you can
    improve search performance by setting only those properties that you need to
    search as <literal>"searchable"</literal>. Properties that are searchable
    are created within the corresponding properties table. The properties table
    exists only for searches or look-ups, and has a composite index, based on
    the resource, then the property name.
   </para>
   <para>
    To restrict searches to specific properties, set the
    <literal>"searchableDefault"</literal> to false for the mapping, and then
    explicitly set <literal>"searchable"</literal> to true for each property
    that should be searched. The following sample extract from
    <filename>repo.jdbc.json</filename> indicates searches restricted to the
    <literal>"userName"</literal> property.

   <para>
    With this configuration, OpenIDM creates entries in the properties table
    only for <literal>"userName"</literal> properties of managed user objects.
   </para>

    properties that do not have a searchable attribute explicitly set to true
    are not written in the properties table.

   <title>Using Explicit Mappings</title>
   <para>
    Explicit mapping is more difficult to set up and maintain, but can take
    complete advantage of the native database facilities.
   </para>
   <para>
    An explicit table offers better performance and simpler queries. There is
    less work in the reading and writing of data, since the data is all in a
    single row of a single table. In addition, it is easier to create different
    types of indexes that apply to only specific fields in an explicit table.
    The disadvantage of explicit tables is the additional work required in
    creating the table in the schema. Also, because rows in a table are
    inherently more simple, it is more difficult to deal with complex objects.
    Any non-simple key:value pair in an object associated with an explicit table
    is converted to a JSON string and stored in the cell in that format. This
    makes the value difficult to use, from the perspective of a query attempting
    to search within it.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that it is possible to have a generic mapping configuration for most
    managed objects, <emphasis>and</emphasis> to have an explicit mapping that
    overrides the default generic mapping in certain cases. The sample
    configuration provided in
    <filename>/path/to/openidm/db/mysql/conf/repo.jdbc-mysql-explicit-managed-user.json</filename>
    has a generic mapping for managed objects, but an explicit mapping for
    managed user objects.
   </para>
   <para>
    OpenIDM uses explicit mapping for internal system tables, such as the tables
    used for auditing.
   </para>
   <para>
    Depending on the types of usage your system is supporting, you might find
    that an explicit mapping performs better than a generic mapping. Operations
    such as sorting and searching (such as those performed in the default UI)
    tend to be faster with explicitly-mapped objects, for example.
   </para>

    The following sample explicit mapping object illustrates how
    <literal>internal/user</literal> objects are stored in an explicit table.
