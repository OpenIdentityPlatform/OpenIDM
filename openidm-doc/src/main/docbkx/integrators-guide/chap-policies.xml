 <title>Using Policies to Validate Data</title>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Policies</primary>
 </indexterm>

  <para>OpenIDM provides an extensible policy service that enables you to 
  apply specific validation requirements to various components and properties. 
  The policy service provides a REST interface for reading policy requirements 
  and validating the properties of components against configured policies. 
  Objects and properties are validated automatically when they are created, 
  updated, or patched. Policies can be applied to user passwords, but also to 
  any kind of managed object.</para>
  
  <para>The policy service enables you to do the following:</para>
 
 <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
     <para>Read the configured policy requirements of a specific component.
     </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>Read the configured policy requirements of all components.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>Validate a component object against the configured policies.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>Validate the properties of a component against the configured 
     policies.</para>
   </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 
  <para>A default policy applies to all managed objects. You can configure the 
  default policy to suit your requirements, or you can extend the policy 
  service by supplying your own scripted policies.</para>

  <section xml:id="configuring-default-policy">
    <title>Configuring the Default Policy</title>
    
    <para>The default policy is configured in two files:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A policy script file 
        (<filename>openidm/bin/defaults/script/policy.js</filename>) which 
        defines each policy and specifies how policy validation is performed.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A policy configuration file 
        (<filename>openidm/conf/policy.json</filename>) which specifies which 
        policies are applicable to each resource.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <section xml:id="policy-script-file">
      <title>Policy Script File</title>
      
      <para>
       The policy script file defines policy configuration in two parts:
      </para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         A policy configuration object, which defines each element of the policy.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         A policy implementation function, which describes the requirements that
         are enforced by that policy.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>Together, the configuration object and the implementation function 
      determine whether an object is valid in terms of the policy. The following 
      extract from the policy script file configures a policy that specifies 
      that the value of a property must contain a certain number of capital 
      letters.</para>

    <para>You can extend the policy service by adding your own scripted 
    policies in <filename>openidm/script</filename> and referencing them in 
    the policy configuration file (<filename>conf/policy.json</filename>). 
    Avoid manipulating the default policy script file (in 
    <literal>bin/defaults/script</literal>) as doing so might result in 
    interoperability issues in a future release. To reference additional 
    policy scripts, set the <literal>"additionalFiles"</literal> property in 
    <filename>conf/policy.json</filename>.</para>
    
    <para>The following example creates a custom policy that rejects 
    properties with null values. The policy is defined in a script named 
    <literal>mypolicy.js</literal>.</para>

var policy = {   "policyId" : "notNull",

   if (value == null) {
       return [ {"policyRequirement": "NOT_NULL"}];
   }
   return [];

   <para>You can also configure policies for managed object properties as
    part of the property definition in the <filename>conf/managed.json</filename>
    file. For example, the following extract of a managed.json file shows a
    policy configuration for the <literal>password</literal> property.</para>

    <title>Disabling Policy Enforcement</title>
    
     <para>Policy enforcement refers to the automatic validation of data in 
     the repository when it is created, updated, or patched. In certain 
     situations you might want to disable policy enforcement temporarily. You 
     might, for example, want to import existing data that does not meet the 
     validation requirements with the intention of cleaning up this data at a 
     later stage.</para>
       
     <para>You can disable policy enforcement by setting 
     <literal>openidm.policy.enforcement.enabled</literal> to 
     <literal>false</literal> in the <filename>conf/boot/boot.properties</filename> 
     file. This setting disables policy enforcement in the back-end only, and 
     has no impact on direct policy validation calls to the Policy Service 
     (which the user interface makes to validate input fields). So, with policy 
     enforcement disabled, data added directly over REST is not subject to 
     validation, but data added with the UI is still subject to validation.
