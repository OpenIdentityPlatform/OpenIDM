 <title>OpenIDM Compatibility</title>

 <para>This chapter covers both major changes to existing functionality, and
 also deprecated and removed functionality.</para>

 <section xml:id="major-changes">
  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
  
  <para>The following changes will have an impact on existing deployments. 
  Read these changes carefully and adjust existing scripts and clients 
  accordingly.</para>
  
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Changes to the scheduler configuration</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The way in which scheduled tasks is configured has changed, as 
        described in <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-scheduler-conf" 
        xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">
        <citetitle>Scheduling Tasks and Events</citetitle></link>.</para>    
        <para>Schedules are now defined in files named 
        <literal>openidm/conf/schedule-*.json</literal>. If you use the 
        previous naming convention (scheduler-*.json), the schedules will not 
        be launched.</para>      
      </listitem>   
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Reconciliation now on <literal>recon</literal> service</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>In previous releases, reconciliation was called on the 
        <literal>sync</literal> service. This API has been deprecated and 
        reconciliation is now called on the <literal>recon</literal> service. 
        For example, a reconciliation operation that previously targeted the 
        following URL:</para>
        <screen width="91">  
"http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=sync&amp;mapping=systemLdapAccounts_managedUser"
        </screen>
        <para>would now use the following URL:</para>
        <screen width="91">  
"http://localhost:8080/openidm/recon?_action=recon&amp;mapping=systemLdapAccounts_managedUser"
        </screen>       
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Audit log changes</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Timestamps now have milliseconds and are in UTC timezone.
        </para>
        <para>The access log now has an additional field, <literal>userid</literal>,
        which is the OpenIDM ID for a managed or internal user who is logged in. 
        For authentication via SSL mutual auth only, the 
        <literal>userid</literal> is currently <literal>null</literal> because 
        there is no direct associated user in OpenIDM.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Database schema changes</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <literal>reconID</literal> column has been removed from the 
        <literal>links</literal> table.</para>
        <para>The size of the <literal>linkType</literal> column in the
        <literal>links</literal> table has been reduced to 255 characters. This 
        is because MySQL can only create unique indexes on that size for UTF-8 
        encoding.</para>
        <para>The <literal>links</literal> table indexes have been changed to
        unique indexes to prevent duplication.</para>
      </listitem>            
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Changes to token definitions in OrientDB query definitions</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Existing <literal>repo.orientdb.json</literal> query definitions 
        with tokens like <literal>${mytoken}</literal> must be reviewed and 
        adjusted to match the new definition which aligns declarations for 
        regular and prepared statement uses.</para>
        <para>Existing <literal>${token}</literal> tokens are now suitable for
        quoted strings by default. Prefixes such as <literal>unquoted:</literal> 
        and <literal>dotnotation:</literal> allow you to use queries in contexts 
        where the unquoted value or the JSON pointer converted to OrientDB dot 
        notation should be inserted.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>New queries in <literal>repo.*.json</literal> definitions</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>query-by-linkType</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Security context changes</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The request context now includes the security context of the 
        user that is associated with the call.</para>
        <para>The <literal>"user"</literal> property has been renamed 
        <literal>"username"</literal>, the name used to log in (for example, 
        to authenticate against an access manager).</para>

   <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
   <para>The following changes should not have an impact on existing deployment 
   configurations.</para>
   
   <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
       <term>Connection pooling is on by default</term>
       <listitem>
         <para>For existing configurations, keep this setting off unless you 
         explicitly require it to be changed.</para>

     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
       <term>Explicit definition of username, password, and role</term>
       <listitem>
         <para>The authentication configuration now explicitly defines which 
         properties from the query represent the username, password, and role. 
         Existing configurations rely on the logic of the query order to 
         determine which property is which.

     <varlistentry>
       <term>Prefetching of links during reconciliation operations</term>
       <listitem>
         <para>All links are now queried at the start of a correlation and the 
         results of that query are used.</para>
