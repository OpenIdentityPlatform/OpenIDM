 <title>OpenIDM Compatibility</title>

 <para>
  This chapter covers major and minor changes to existing functionality, as well
  as deprecated and removed functionality in this release of OpenIDM. You must
  read this chapter before commencing a migration from a previous OpenIDM
  release.

 <section xml:id="major-changes">
  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
  
  <para>
   The following changes will have an impact on existing deployments. Read these
   changes carefully and adjust existing scripts and clients accordingly.
  </para>
  
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to indexing for JDBC repositories</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To improve indexing across the various supported JDBC repositories, a
      change has been made for all generic object mappings. The size of the
      <literal>propvalue</literal> column in the
      <literal>objectproperties</literal> tables (used for searches) is
      now limited to 2000 characters for all repositories other than MS SQL.
      Longer values are truncated. For MS SQL repositories, the
      <literal>propvalue</literal> column is restricted to 195 characters.
     </para>
     <para>
      Incoming searches are trimmed accordingly, so that search filters such as
      <literal>equals</literal> do not break for the truncated column values.

  <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
  <para>
   The following changes should not have an impact on existing deployment
   configurations.

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Change to roles assignment operation scripts</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The scripts that specify how role values are assigned
       (<literal>replaceTarget.js</literal> and
       <literal>mergeWithTarget.js</literal>) now pass back a map containing the
       new value for the target object field and, optionally, an updated
       <literal>attributesInfo</literal> object. Previously, these scripts
       simply returned the new value of the target object field.
      </para>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to Connector Configuration Creation</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The way in which you generate connector configurations for access to
      external resources has changed. There are now three separate actions
      involved creating the connector configuration. For more information, see
      <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="integrators-guide#connector-wiz"
      xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Creating
      Default Connector Configurations</citetitle></link> in the
      <emphasis>Integrator's Guide</emphasis>.
     </para>
     <para>
      The previous method of creating a connector configuration is retained in
      this release, for compatibility.
