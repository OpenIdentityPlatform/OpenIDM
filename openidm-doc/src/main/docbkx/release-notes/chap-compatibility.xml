  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
  
  <para>
   The following changes will have an impact on existing deployments. Read these
   changes carefully and adjust existing scripts and clients accordingly.

    <term>Changes to the audit facility</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      OpenIDM ${docTargetVersion} replaces the existing audit facility with a
      new facility that is common across ForgeRock's Identity Platform. This
      change has the following effect on the JDBC schema of existing OpenIDM
      deployments:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A new <literal>auditauthentication</literal> table for the
        authentication log. This table has the following explicit mapping:
       </para>
       <programlisting>"objectToColumn" : {
    "_id" : "objectid",
    "transactionId" : "transactionid",
    "timestamp" : "activitydate",
    "authentication/id" : "userid",
    "eventName" : "eventname",
    "result" : "result",
    "principal" : {"column" : "principals", "type" : "JSON_LIST"},
    "context" : {"column" : "context", "type" : "JSON_MAP"},
    "sessionId" : "sessionid",
    "entries" : {"column" : "entries", "type" : "JSON_LIST"}
}</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Changes to the object to column mapping for the
        <literal>auditaccess</literal>, <literal>auditactivity</literal>,
        <literal>auditrecon</literal>, and <literal>auditsync</literal> tables.
        For details of the changes, see the <filename>repo.jdbc.json</filename>
        file for your repository type.

 <section xml:id="minor-changes">
  <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
  <para>
   The following changes should not have an impact on existing deployment
   configurations.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Removal of predefined queries for audits</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      As the functionality exists with <literal>queryFilter</literal>, the
      following pre-defined queries have been removed from the default
      configuration: <literal>audit-last-recon-for-mapping</literal>,
      <literal>audit-by-recon-id-situations-latest</literal>, and
      <literal>audit-by-recon-id-situations-latest-filtered</literal>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to the database schema</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A new column, <literal>linkQualifier</literal>, has been added to the
      <literal>links</literal> table. This column enables correlation between
      a single source object and multiple target objects. Predefined queries on
      the links table have been adjusted accordingly.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to Logging Output</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The reconciliation and synchronization logs now include an additional
      <literal>linkQualifier</literal> field, which is used in the context of
      mapping a single source object to multiple target objects.
     </para>
