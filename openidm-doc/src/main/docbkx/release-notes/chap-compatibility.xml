 <title>OpenIDM Compatibility</title>

 <para>
  This chapter covers major and minor changes to existing functionality, as well
  as deprecated and removed functionality in this release of OpenIDM. You must
  read this chapter before commencing a migration from a previous OpenIDM
  release.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="major-changes">
  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
  
  <para>
   The following changes will have an impact on existing deployments. Read these
   changes carefully and adjust existing scripts and clients accordingly.
  </para>
  
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to indexing for JDBC repositories</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To improve indexing across the various supported JDBC repositories, a
      change has been made for all generic object mappings. The size of the
      <literal>propvalue</literal> column in the
      <literal>objectproperties</literal> tables (used for searches) is
      now limited to 2000 characters for all repositories other than MS SQL.
      Longer values are truncated. For MS SQL repositories, the
      <literal>propvalue</literal> column is restricted to 195 characters.
     </para>
     <para>
      Incoming searches are trimmed accordingly, so that search filters such as
      <literal>equals</literal> do not break for the truncated column values.
     </para>

  <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
  <para>
   The following changes should not have an impact on existing deployment
   configurations.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Change to roles assignment operation scripts</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The scripts that specify how role values are assigned
       (<literal>replaceTarget.js</literal> and
       <literal>mergeWithTarget.js</literal>) now pass back a map containing the
       new value for the target object field and, optionally, an updated
       <literal>attributesInfo</literal> object. Previously, these scripts
       simply returned the new value of the target object field.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to connector configuration creation</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The way in which you generate connector configurations for access to
      external resources has changed. There are now three separate actions
      involved in creating the connector configuration. For more information,
      see <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="integrators-guide#connector-wiz"
      xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Creating
      Default Connector Configurations</citetitle></link> in the
      <emphasis>Integrator's Guide</emphasis>.
     </para>
     <para>
      The previous method of creating a connector configuration is retained in
      this release, for compatibility.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>New location for sample JDBC repository configurations</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The sample JDBC repository configurations, previously located at
      <filename>openidm/samples/misc/repo.jdbc-<replaceable>repo-type</replaceable>.json</filename>,
      are now located at
      <filename>openidm/db/<replaceable>repo-type</replaceable>/conf/repo.jdbc.json</filename>.
      The files no longer need to be renamed before being copied to your
      project's <literal>conf</literal> directory.
