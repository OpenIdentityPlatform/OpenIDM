 <title>OpenIDM Compatibility</title>

 <para>
  This chapter covers major and minor changes to existing functionality, as well
  as deprecated and removed functionality in this release of OpenIDM. You must
  read this chapter before commencing a migration from a previous OpenIDM
  release.

 <section xml:id="major-changes">
  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
  
  <para>
   The following changes will have an impact on existing deployments. Read these
   changes carefully and adjust existing scripts and clients accordingly.
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to indexing for JDBC repositories</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To improve indexing across the various supported JDBC repositories, a
      change has been made for all generic object mappings. The size of the
      <literal>propvalue</literal> column in the
      <literal>objectproperties</literal> tables (used for searches) is
      now limited to 2000 characters for all repositories other than MS SQL.
      Longer values are truncated. For MS SQL repositories, the
      <literal>propvalue</literal> column is restricted to 195 characters.
     </para>
     <para>
      Incoming searches are trimmed accordingly, so that search filters such as
      <literal>equals</literal> do not break for the truncated column values.

  <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
  <para>
   The following changes should not have an impact on existing deployment
   configurations.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Removal of predefined queries for audits</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      As the functionality exists with <literal>queryFilter</literal>, the
      following pre-defined queries have been removed from the default
      configuration: <literal>audit-last-recon-for-mapping</literal>,
      <literal>audit-by-recon-id-situations-latest</literal>, and
      <literal>audit-by-recon-id-situations-latest-filtered</literal>.

    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to the database schema</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A new column, <literal>linkQualifier</literal>, has been added to the
      <literal>links</literal> table. This column enables correlation between
      a single source object and multiple target objects. Predefined queries on
      the links table have been adjusted accordingly.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to Logging Output</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The reconciliation and synchronization logs now include an additional
      <literal>linkQualifier</literal> field, which is used in the context of
      mapping a single source object to multiple target objects.
