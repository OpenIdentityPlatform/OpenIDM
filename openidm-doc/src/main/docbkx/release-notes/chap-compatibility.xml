 <title>OpenIDM Compatibility</title>

 <para>
  This chapter covers major and minor changes to existing functionality, as well
  as deprecated and removed functionality in this release of OpenIDM. You must
  read this chapter before commencing a migration from a previous OpenIDM
  release.

 <section xml:id="major-changes">
  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
  
  <para>
   The following changes will have an impact on existing deployments. Read these
   changes carefully and adjust existing scripts and clients accordingly.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to the audit facility</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      OpenIDM ${docTargetVersion} replaces the existing audit facility with a
      new facility that is common across ForgeRock's Identity Platform. This
      change has the following effect on the JDBC schema of existing OpenIDM
      deployments:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A new <literal>auditauthentication</literal> table for the
        authentication log. This table has the following explicit mapping:
       </para>
       <programlisting>"objectToColumn" : {
    "_id" : "objectid",
    "transactionId" : "transactionid",
    "timestamp" : "activitydate",
    "authentication/id" : "userid",
    "eventName" : "eventname",
    "result" : "result",
    "principal" : {"column" : "principals", "type" : "JSON_LIST"},
    "context" : {"column" : "context", "type" : "JSON_MAP"},
    "sessionId" : "sessionid",
    "entries" : {"column" : "entries", "type" : "JSON_LIST"}
}</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Changes to the object to column mapping for the
        <literal>auditaccess</literal>, <literal>auditactivity</literal>,
        <literal>auditrecon</literal>, and <literal>auditsync</literal> tables.
        For details of the changes, see the <filename>repo.jdbc.json</filename>
        file for your repository type.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Updated REST API</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      OpenIDM has migrated to an updated version of the ForgeRock Common REST
      API. This update entails the following migration requirements for existing
      deployments.
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The <literal>resourceName</literal> object has been renamed to
        <literal>resourcePath</literal>. Custom scripts that request this object
        must be updated accordingly, for example
       <literallayout>request.resourceName</literallayout> must be replaced with
       <literallayout>request.resourcePath</literallayout>.
       </para>
       <para>
        Implementations that use a scripted CREST connector must also update
        their scripts with this change. For example, note the change to the
        following line in the <filename>UpdateScript.groovy</filename> script,
        provided in the <literal>scriptedcrest2dj</literal> sample.
       </para>
<programlisting>UpdateRequest updateRequest = Requests.newUpdateRequest(request.resourcePath, resource.content)</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The way in which context IDs are constructed has changed. OpenIDM now
        concatenates a 36-character UUID with a 64-bit sequence number. The
        context ID is therefore of variable length (37-56 characters). This will
        impact existing implementations where the <literal>transactionId</literal>
        and <literal>reconId</literal> are stored in a database column that uses
        a fixed schema. Corresponding column sizes will need to be increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the <literal>reconId</literal> of a reconciliation
        operation is now constructed from the root context ID of the invocation.
       </para>
       <para>
        For details of the updated schema definitions, see the schema definition
        script for your repository
        (<filename>/path/to/openidm/db/<replaceable>repo-name</replaceable>/scripts/openidm.sql</filename>).
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The paging implementation has changed to improve the performance when
        counting results. Previously, the default behavior was to return the
        number of <emphasis>remaining results</emphasis>, which necessitated a
        time-consuming calculation for every request. In OpenIDM
        ${docTargetVersion}, the default behavior is to return the
        <emphasis>total results</emphasis>. Any clients that rely on
        <literal>remaining results</literal> must be updated accordingly.
       </para>
       <!--TODO Add this note if CREST 2 compatibility is implemented for IDM
       <note>
        <para>
         You can still request a count of remaining results, by specifying
         the previous version of the REST API. To do so, pass in the
         <literal>-header "X-AcceptAPIVersion :1"</literal> header in the
         request.
        </para>
       </note> -->
       <para>
        The updated REST API implementation includes a configurable
        <emphasis>count policy</emphasis>, that can be set per request.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>

  <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
  <para>
   The following changes should not have an impact on existing deployment
   configurations.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Removal of predefined queries for audits</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      As the functionality exists with <literal>queryFilter</literal>, the
      following pre-defined queries have been removed from the default
      configuration: <literal>audit-last-recon-for-mapping</literal>,
      <literal>audit-by-recon-id-situations-latest</literal>, and
      <literal>audit-by-recon-id-situations-latest-filtered</literal>.

    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to the database schema</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A new column, <literal>linkQualifier</literal>, has been added to the
      <literal>links</literal> table. This column enables correlation between
      a single source object and multiple target objects. Predefined queries on
      the links table have been adjusted accordingly.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Changes to Logging Output</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The reconciliation and synchronization logs now include an additional
      <literal>linkQualifier</literal> field, which is used in the context of
      mapping a single source object to multiple target objects.
     </para>
