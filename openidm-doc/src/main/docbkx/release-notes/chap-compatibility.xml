   <title>Minor Changes to Existing Functionality</title>
   
   <para>
    The following change will have a minor impact on existing deployments.
   </para>
   
   <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
       <term>Change to additional policy specification</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         With the resolution of <link
         xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENIDM-1256"
         xlink:show="new">OPENIDM-1256</link>, the way in which additional
         policy files are referenced in the <filename>policy.json</filename>
         configuration file has changed.
        </para>
        <para>
         In previous OpenIDM versions, the path to additional policy files was
         relative to the root of the OpenIDM installation directory. In OpenIDM
         ${docTargetVersion}, the path to additional files is relative to the
         <emphasis>project</emphasis> directory (if you start the server using
         the <literal>-p</literal> option).
        </para>
        <para>
         For example, if you had started OpenIDM with the configuration for
         Sample 1 in a previous version, you would have specified an additional
         policy file as follows:
        </para>
        <programlisting>{
    "type" : "text/javascript",
    "file" : "bin/defaults/script/policy.js",
    "additionalFiles" : [
        "samples/sample1/script/password-policy.js"
    ],
    "resources" : [
...
}
        </programlisting>
        <para>
         In OpenIDM ${docTargetVersion}, you would specify the additional file
         as follows:
        </para>
        <programlisting>{
    "type" : "text/javascript",
    "file" : "bin/defaults/script/policy.js",
    "additionalFiles" : [
        "script/password-policy.js"
    ],
    "resources" : [
...
}
        </programlisting>
