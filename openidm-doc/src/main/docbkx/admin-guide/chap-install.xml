 <title>Installing and Starting OpenIDM Services</title>
    
    <!-- TODO: Any (new) information in this chapter belongs in the installation
               guide rather than the admin guide. -->

 <para>A short description of the install procedure follows below. For a more 
    detailed description including some sample configurations please consult the 
    install guide. For exact prerequisites like JVM versions please consult the 
    release notes.</para>
 <section>
  <title>Install OpenIDM</title>
  <para>Installing OpenIDM is as simple as to download the openidm.zip file and 
    unzip the archive. The latest build can be fould here: <link
     xlink:href='http://forgerock.org/openidm.html'>download page.</link></para>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Uninstall OpenIDM</title>

  <title>Start and Stop OpenIDM</title>
  <section>
   <title>Start and Stop OpenIDM in Interactive Mode</title>
   <para>The simplest way to start OpenIDM is to execute the start.sh script 
        (or the run.bat on windows). This will start OpenIDM in a mode where it will 
        report all out put to the OSGI console. The console also accepts OSGI commands like 
        "scr list" in this mode. OpenIDM can simply be started with: </para>
   <programlisting>./start</programlisting>
   <para>To stop OpenIDM in this mode type the following on the OSGI console:</para>
   <programlisting>->shutdown</programlisting>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Start OpenIDM in the Background</title>
   <para>As prerequisite of starting OpenIDM in the background, the ConsoleHandler 
        of OSGI must be disabled. This can be done in one of the following ways:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>In conf/logging.properties set java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = OFF</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The ConsoleHandler is removed from the list of handlers in the same file.</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>OpenIDM can then be started in the background with: </para>
   <programlisting>./start &amp;</programlisting>
   <para>Stopping the instanc will now be done with the stop command: </para>
   <programlisting>./stop</programlisting>
