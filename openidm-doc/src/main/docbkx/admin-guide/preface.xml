 <title>Preface</title>
 
 <para>This guide shows you how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot
 OpenIDM services.</para>

 <section>
  <title>Who Should Use this Guide</title>
  
  <para>This guide is written for identity management designers and
   administrators who build, deploy, and maintain OpenIDM services for
   their organizations. This guide covers the tasks you might repeat
   throughout the life cycle of an OpenIDM release used in your
   organization.</para>
   
  <para>This guide starts by introducing the OpenIDM administrative
   interfaces and tools, and by showing how to manage OpenIDM services.
   This guide continues by showing how to configure the principle
   features of OpenIDM.</para>
   
  <para>You do not need to be an OpenIDM wizard to learn something from
   this guide, though a background in access management and maintaining
   web application software can help. You do need some background in
   managing services on your operating systems and in your application
   servers. You can nevertheless get started with this guide, and then
   learn more as you go along.</para>

  <title>Formatting Conventions</title>
  
  <note><para>Pay attention to notes like this one.</para></note>
  
  <para>Some items might be formatted differently from other text, like
  <filename>filenames</filename>, <command>commands</command>, and
  <literal>literal values</literal>.</para>
  
  <screen>$ echo Terminal sessions are formatted like this.
Terminal sessions are formatted like this.</screen>

  <programlisting language='java'>class Test
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        System.out.println("This is a program listing.");

    }
}</programlisting>
  
  <para>In many cases, sections pertaining to UNIX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, BSD,
  and so forth are marked (UNIX). Sections pertaining to Microsoft Windows
  might be marked (Windows). To avoid repetition, however, file system
  directory names are often given only in UNIX format as in
  <filename>/path/to/OpenIDM</filename>, even if the text applies to
  <filename>C:\path\to\OpenIDM</filename> as well.</para>

  <title>Accessing OpenIDM Documentation Online</title>
  
  <para>Core documentation, such as what you are now reading, aims to
  be technically accurate and complete with respect to the software
  documented. Core documentation therefore follows a <link
  xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/devcom/Documentation+Review+Process'
  >three-phase review process</link> designed to eliminate errors. The
  review process should slow authors down enough that documentation you get
  with a stable release has had time to bake fully.</para>
  
  <!-- TODO: online location of core documentation, perhaps docs.forgerock.org? -->
  <para>Fully baked core documentation is available at <link
  xlink:href='http://...'>...</link>.</para>
  
  <para>You need not wait until the core documentation is finished, though,
  to read more about OpenIDM, and also to read about related topics that
  involve OpenIDM without being strictly about OpenIDM. The <link
  xlink:href='http://wikis.forgerock.org/openidm/'>OpenIDM Wiki</link> regularly
  brings you more, fresh content. In addition, you are welcome to <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> and then edit the Wiki if you notice an error, or if you
  have something to share.</para>

 <section>
  <title>Joining the OpenIDM Community</title>
  
  <para>After you <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> at ForgeRock, you can also login to the Wiki and the issue
  database to follow what is happening with the project.</para>
  
  <para>If you have questions regarding OpenIDM which are not answered by the
  documentation, there is a mailing list which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm</link> where you are
  likely to find an answer.</para>
  
  <para>The Wiki has information on how to check out OpenIDM source code.
  There is also a mailing list for OpenIDM development which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm-dev'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm-dev</link>
  Should you want to contribute a patch, test, or feature, or want to author
  part of the core documentation, first have a look on the ForgeRock site
  at <link xlink:href='http://www.forgerock.com/fcpa-faq.html'>how to get
  involved</link>.</para>
