  <title>Who Should Use This Guide</title>
  
  <para>
   This guide is written for identity management developers and
   administrators who build, deploy, and maintain OpenIDM services for
   their organizations. This guide covers the tasks you need to quickly
   get OpenIDM running on your system.
  </para>

  <para>
   As you read this guide, you will see how OpenIDM reconciles customer
   identity data to ensure accurate information across disparate
   resources within an organization.
  </para>

  <para>
   You will also read about what else OpenIDM can do, in the areas of
   provisioning, self-service workflows, and password management. You will
   also read about how OpenIDM connects to a variety of remote data
   stores, with links to detailed documentation.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, engineers might access their systems through Active
   Directory accounts. Those same engineers might need to update their
   information in a Human Resources database, stored in a separate LDAP
   directory. With OpenIDM, you can keep those user identities synchronized,
   so each engineer only has to update their data once.
