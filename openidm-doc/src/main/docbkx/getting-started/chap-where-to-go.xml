 <para>
  OpenIDM can do much more than reconcile data between two different sources.
  In this chapter, you will read about the key features of OpenIDM,
  with links to additional information about each feature.

 <!-- TODO: May need a dedicated section on self-service features -->

 <section xml:id="gsg-bpmn">
  <title>Integrating Business Processes and Workflows</title>

  <para>
   A business process begins with an objective and includes a well-defined
   sequence of tasks to meet that objective. In OpenIDM, you can configure
   many of these tasks as self-service workflows, such as self-registration,
   new user onboarding, and account certification.
  </para>

  <para>
   With OpenIDM, you can automate many of these tasks as a workflow.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you configure the right workflows, a newly-hired engineer can log
   into OpenIDM and request access to manufacturing information.
  </para>

  <para>
   That request is sent to the appropriate manager for approval. Once approved,
   the OpenIDM provisions the new engineer with access to manufacturing.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenIDM supports workflow-driven provisioning activities, based on the
   embedded  <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://activiti.org">
   <citetitle>Activiti</citetitle></link> Process Engine, which complies with
   the <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/">
   <citetitle>Business Process Model and Notation 2.0</citetitle></link>
   (BPMN 2.0) standard.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenIDM integrates additional workflows such as new user onboarding, orphan
   account detection, and password change reminders. For more information, see
   the section in the <citetitle>Integrator's Guide</citetitle> on
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
         xlink:href="integrators-guide#workflow-use-cases">
    <citetitle>Workflow Use Cases</citetitle></link>.
  </para>

 </section>

 <section xml:id="gsg-passwords">
  <title>Managing Passwords</title>

  <para>
   When you first logged into OpenIDM, you should have seen the following
   screen:

   <alt>OpenIDM Password Dialog</alt>
   <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="images/gsg-password.png" format="PNG"/>
   </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>

  <para>
   As you can see, OpenIDM supports a robust password policy. As described
   in the chapter on
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
         xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-passwords"><citetitle>Managing
   Passwords</citetitle></link>, you can modify the rules shown, or add
   more rules such as the following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Elements that should not be a part of a password, such as a family name
    </para>
   </listitem>

    <para>
     Password expiration dates
    </para>

   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="gsg-role-management">
  <title>Managing User Roles</title>

  <para>
   Some users need accounts on multiple systems. For example, insurance
   agents may also have insurance policies with the company that they work
   for. In that situation, the insurance agent is also a customer of the
   company.
  </para>

  <para>
   Alternatively, a salesperson may also test customer engineering
   scenarios. That salesperson may also need access to engineering
   systems.
  </para>

  <para>
   In OpenIDM, each of these user scenarios is known as a
   <emphasis>role</emphasis>. OpenIDM allows you to set up a consolidated
   set of attributes associated with each role. To do so, you would
   configure custom roles to assign to selected users. For example, you may
   assign both <emphasis>insured</emphasis> and <emphasis>agent</emphasis>
   roles to an agent, while assigning the <emphasis>insured</emphasis> role
   to all customers.
  </para>

  <para>
   In a similar fashion, OpenIDM allows you to assign both
   <emphasis>sales</emphasis> and <emphasis>engineering</emphasis> roles
   to the sales engineer.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can then synchronize users with those roles into appropriate data
   stores.
  </para>

  <para>
   For more information, read the OpenIDM Integrator's Guide section on

  <title>Connecting to Remote Data Stores</title>

  <para>
   You can use OpenIDM to connect to a substantial variety user and device
   data stores, on premise and in the cloud. While OpenIDM can connect to some
   connectors dedicated to a few data stores, OpenIDM can also connect to
   many more data stores using a scripted connector framework.

 <section xml:id="gsg-recon">
  <title>Reconciliation</title>

  <para>
   OpenIDM supports reconciliation between two data stores, as a
   source and a target.
  </para>

  <para>
   In identity management, reconciliation compares the contents of objects
   in different data stores, and makes decisions based on configurable
   policies.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, if you have an application that maintains its own user store,
   OpenIDM can ensure your canonical directory attributes are kept up to date
   by reconciling their values as they are changed.
  </para>

  <para>
