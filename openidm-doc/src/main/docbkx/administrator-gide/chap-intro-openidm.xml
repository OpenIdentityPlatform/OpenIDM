    <title>Introduction to OpenIDM</title>
    <para>The goal of OpenIDM is to manage and synchronize identity related objects 
    between many different object repositories and to minimize the work of maintaining 
    an organization's identities and user's access to different applications through role 
    and group management. OpenIDM is able to maintain user as well as other objects like 
    groups in external repositories.</para>

        <title>OpenIDM Components</title>
        <para>OpenIDM services run in an OSGi container with an embedded Servlet
        container, and an embedded noSQL database. By default the OSGi container is
        Apache Felix. The default Servlet container is Jetty. The default noSQL
        database is OrientDB. At this time the only supported configuration is
        running the services in Apache Felix.</para>
        <para>The default database can easily be replaced by an other jdbc based 
        database like mysql. Further more it is also possible to embed OpenIDM in a 
        war file and deploy that to a web container.</para>
