 <title>Preface</title>
 
 <para>This guide shows you how to install core OpenIDM services for identity
 management, provisioning, and compliance. Unless you are planning a throwaway
 evaluation or test installation, read the <link

 xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Release
 Notes</citetitle></link> before you get started.</para>

 <section>
  <title>Who Should Use this Guide</title>
  <para>This guide is written for anyone installing OpenIDM to manage and to
  provision identities, and to ensure compliance with identity management
  regulations.</para>

  <para>This guide covers the install and removal (uninstall)
  procedures that you theoretically perform only once per version. This
  guide aims to provide you with at least some idea of what happens
  behind the scenes when you perform the steps.</para>

  <para>This guide also takes you through all of the samples provided with
  OpenIDM.</para>

  <para>You do not need to be an OpenIDM wizard to learn something from
  this guide, though a background in identity management and maintaining
  web application software can help. You do need some background in
  managing services on your operating systems and in your application
  servers. You can nevertheless get started with this guide, and then
  learn more as you go along.</para>
  
  <para>If you have a previous version of OpenIDM installed, see the 
  <link xlink:href="release-notes#chap-compatibility" 
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink">
  <citetitle>Compatibility</citetitle></link> section of the 
  <citetitle>Release Notes</citetitle> before installing this version.</para>
