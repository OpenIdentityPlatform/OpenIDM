 <title>Preface</title>
 
 <para>This guide shows you how to install core OpenIDM services for identity
 management, provisioning, and compliance. Unless you are planning a throwaway
 evaluation or test installation, read the <link
 xlink:href="release-notes#release-notes"
 xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Release
 Notes</citetitle></link> before you get started.</para>

 <section>
  <title>Who Should Use this Guide</title>
  
  <para>This guide is written for anyone installing OpenIDM to manage and to
  provision identities, and to ensure compliance with identity management
  regulations.</para>
   
  <para>This guide covers the install, upgrade, and removal (uninstall)
  procedures that you theoretically perform only once per version. This
  guide aims to provide you with at least some idea of what happens
  behind the scenes when you perform the steps.</para>
   
  <para>You do not need to be an OpenIDM wizard to learn something from
  this guide, though a background in identity management and maintaining
  web application software can help. You do need some background in
  managing services on your operating systems and in your application
  servers. You can nevertheless get started with this guide, and then
  learn more as you go along.</para>

  <filename>filenames</filename>, <command>commands</command>, and

  <para>Sections pertaining to UNIX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, BSD,

  <title>Accessing OpenIDM Documentation Online</title>
  
  <para>Core documentation, such as what you are now reading, aims to
  be technically accurate and complete with respect to the software
  documented. Core documentation therefore follows a <link
  xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/devcom/Review+Process'
  >three-phase review process</link> designed to eliminate errors. The
  review process should slow authors down enough that documentation you get
  with a stable release has had time to bake fully.</para>
  
  <!-- TODO: online location of core documentation, perhaps docs.forgerock.org? -->
  <para>Fully baked core documentation is available at <link
  xlink:href='http://...'>...</link>.</para>
  
  <para>The <link xlink:href="http://wikis.forgerock.org/openidm/"
  xlink:show="new">OpenIDM Wiki</link> regularly brings you more, fresh
  content. In addition, you are welcome to <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register">sign
  up</link> and then edit the Wiki if you notice an error, or if you have
  something to share.</para>

  <title>Joining the OpenIDM Community</title>
  
  <para>After you <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> at ForgeRock, you can also login to the Wiki and the issue
  database to follow what is happening with the project.</para>
  
  <para>If you have questions regarding OpenIDM which are not answered by the
  documentation, there is a mailing list which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm</link> where you are
  likely to find an answer.</para>
  
  <para>The Wiki has information on how to check out OpenIDM source code.
  There is also a mailing list for OpenIDM development which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm-dev'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openidm-dev</link>
  Should you want to contribute a patch, test, or feature, or want to author
  part of the core documentation, first have a look on the ForgeRock site
  at <link xlink:href='http://www.forgerock.org/get_involved.html'>how to get
