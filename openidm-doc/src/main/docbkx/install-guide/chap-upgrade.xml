 <title>Migrating to OpenIDM 3.0.0</title>

 <para>
  The migration process is largely dependent on your particular deployment and
  on the extent to which you have customized OpenIDM. It is recommended that you
  engage ForgeRock services for help in migrating an existing deployment.
 </para>
 <para>
  The steps outlined in this section indicate how to preserve customizations,
  where possible, and take advantage of the new functionality offered in this
  release. However, you must be aware of the changes made in
  OpenIDM 3.0.0 that might affect your existing deployment.
  Therefore, before starting this process, see the <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="release-notes#chap-compatibility"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Compatibility
  chapter</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Release Notes</citetitle>, and
  adjust your scripts and clients accordingly.
 </para>
 <para>
  In particular, for client applications that use the REST API, note that this
  API has undergone major changes in this release. For information on the new
  REST API, see the <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="integrators-guide#appendix-rest"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>REST API
  Reference</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Integrator's Guide</citetitle>.
 </para>

 <procedure>
  <para>
   To perform a basic migration to OpenIDM 3.0.0, follow these
   steps. For the purposes of this procedure, the path to the existing 2.1
   instance is defined as <filename>/path/to/openidm-2.1</filename>. The path to
   the new instance is defined as <filename>/path/to/openidm-3.0</filename>.
  </para>
  <step>
   <para>
    Download and extract the OpenIDM 3.0.0 server.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Stop your existing OpenIDM 2.1 server, if it is running.
   </para>
   <screen>
$ cd /path/to/openidm-2.1
$ ./shutdown.sh
Stopping OpenIDM (81491)
   </screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Back up your existing deployment by zipping up the entire
    <filename>openidm</filename> directory.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    On the OpenIDM 3.0.0 server, edit the
    <filename>conf/boot/boot.properties</filename> file to match any
    customizations that you made on your 2.1 server. Specifically, check the
    following elements:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      In OpenIDM 2.1, port numbers were specified in the
      <filename>conf/jetty.xml</filename> file. In OpenIDM
      ${serverDocTargetVersion}, the HTTP, HTTPS, and mutual authentication
      ports are specified in the <filename>conf/boot/boot.properties</filename>
      file. If you changed the default ports in your 2.x deployment, make sure
      that the corresponding ports are specified in this file.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Check that the keystore and truststore passwords match the current
      passwords for the keystore and truststore of your 2.x deployment
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      For clustered deployments, certain cluster properties are also now
      specified in the <filename>boot.properties</filename> file. Therefore, if
      this migrated OpenIDM instance is going to run in a cluster, set the
      following properties:
     </para>
     <literallayout>openidm.node.id</literallayout>
     <literallayout>openidm.instance.type</literallayout>
     <literallayout>openidm.scheduler.execute.persistent.schedules</literallayout>
     <para>
      In addition, timeout and checkin settings that were previously defined in
      the <filename>conf/scheduler.json</filename> file are now defined in a new
      configuration file, <filename>conf/cluster.json</filename>. Copy any such
      settings that you had defined in the <filename>scheduler.json</filename>
      file to the <filename>cluster.json</filename> file in the
      3.0.0 instance.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Copy the contents of your original <literal>security/</literal> folder to
    the new instance.
   </para>
   <screen>$ cd /path/to/openidm-3.0
$ cp -r /path/to/openidm-2.1/security .
   </screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Migrate any custom scripts or default scripts that you have modified to the
    new instance. In general, custom and customized scripts should be located in
    the <filename>openidm/script</filename> directory on your old instance.
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      For custom scripts (that is, scripts that you have written yourself)
      review the <link xlink:show="new"
      xlink:href="release-notes#chap-compatibility"
      xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Compatibility
      chapter</citetitle></link> to ensure that the scripts will work as
      intended with the new version, then copy these scripts to the new
      instance. For example:
     </para>
     <screen>$ cd /path/to/openidm-3.0
$ cp /path/to/openidm-2.1/script/my-custom-script.js script/
     </screen>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      For OpenIDM scripts that you have modified, compare the modified script
      against the corresponding script in the new OpenIDM instance. If nothing
      has changed in the default script, check that your customizations will
      work as intended (by reviewing the <link xlink:show="new"
      xlink:href="release-notes#chap-compatibility"
      xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Compatibility
      chapter</citetitle></link>) then copy the customized scripts to the new
      <literal>openidm/script</literal> directory. For example:
     </para>
     <screen>$ cd /path/to/openidm-3.0
$ cp /path/to/openidm-2.1/script/policy.js script/
     </screen>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the default script has changed since the 2.1 release (for example,
      <literal>access.js</literal>, copy the new default script to the
      <filename>openidm-3.0/script</filename> directory.
     </para>
     <screen>$ cd /path/to/openidm-3.0
$ cp bin/default/script/access.js script/
     </screen>
     <para>
      Check that your customizations will work as expected, then port your
      customizations to the new script in the
      <filename>openidm-3.0/script</filename> directory.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Several changes have been made to the default configuration in OpenIDM
    3.0.0. Currently, there is no automated way to migrate a
    customized configuration to the new version. The following strategy is
    recommended:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Start with the default 3.0.0 configuration.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      For each configuration file that you have customized, use a file
      comparison (<literal>diff</literal>) utility to assess the differences
      between your customized file and the ${serverDocTargetVersion} file.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Based on the results of the diff, either use your existing file as a base
      and port the 3.0.0 changes to that file, or vice
      versa. Ultimately, you want to preserve your customizations but ensure
      that you are up to date with the latest default configuration. All files
      should end up in the <filename>openidm-3.0/conf</filename> directory.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Modify any customized provisioner configurations in your existing project to
    point to the new connectors that are provided with OpenIDM
    3.0.0. Specifically, check that the
    <literal>"connectorRef"</literal> properties reflect the new connectors, for
    example:
   </para>
   <programlisting language="javascript">{
    "bundleVersion": "1.1.1.3",
    "bundleName": "org.forgerock.openicf.connectors.ldap-connector",
    "displayName": "LDAP Connector",
    "connectorName": "org.identityconnectors.ldap.LdapConnector"
}, </programlisting>
   <para>
    Alternatively, copy the connector .jars from your existing installation into
    the <literal>openidm/connectors/</literal> folder of the new installation.
   </para>
   <para>

    chapter of the <citetitle>Release Notes</citetitle>.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Complete the OpenIDM 3.0.0 installation, as described in the
    <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#chap-install"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Installation
    chapter</citetitle></link>.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Migrate your internal user data, managed objects, and reconciliation and
    audit data, if required.
   </para>
   <para>
    The database schema has changed slightly in
    OpenIDM 3.0.0. The following tables have been added:
    <literal>security</literal>, <literal>securitykeys</literal>,
    <literal>clusterobjects</literal>, and
    <literal>clusterobjectproperties</literal>. In addition, the following
    columns have been added to the <literal>auditrecon</literal> table:
    <literal>actionid</literal>, <literal>exceptiondetail</literal>,
    <literal>mapping</literal>, <literal>messagedetail</literal>.</para>
   <para>
    Your data migration strategy might vary, depending on your repository.

     <para>
      Using the appropriate schema script from the new OpenIDM 3.0.0 instance
      (<filename>/path/to/openidm-3.0/db/scripts/<replaceable>repo</replaceable>/openidm.sql</filename>),
      take the changes described above and apply them to your existing database.
     </para>

   </itemizedlist>
   <itemizedlist>
    <para>
     To start with a new database:
    </para>

     <para>
      Set up a clean repository, using the appropriate schema script from the
      new OpenIDM 3.0.0 instance
      (<filename>/path/to/openidm-3.0/db/scripts/<replaceable>repo</replaceable>/openidm.sql</filename>).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Use a schema comparison tool and adjust the tables in your existing
      repository to match the schema in the new repository.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Export your existing data to the new repository.

  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    If you are using the UI, clear your browser cache after the migration.
    The browser cache contains files from the previous OpenIDM release, that
    might not be refreshed when you log into the new UI.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Start up OpenIDM 3.0.0.
   </para>
