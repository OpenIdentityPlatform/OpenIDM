 <title>Upgrading to OpenIDM ${serverDocTargetVersion}</title>

 <para>
  The upgrade process is largely dependent on your particular deployment and on
  the extent to which you have customized OpenIDM. It is recommended that you
  engage ForgeRock services for help in migrating an existing deployment.
 </para>
 <para>
  The steps outlined in this section indicate how to preserve customizations,
  where possible, and take advantage of the new functionality offered in this
  release. However, you must be aware of the changes made in
  OpenIDM ${serverDocTargetVersion} that might effect your existing deployment.
  Therefore, before starting this process, see the <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="release-notes#chap-compatibility"
  xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Compatibility
  chapter</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Release Notes</citetitle>, and
  adjust your scripts and clients accordingly.
 </para>
