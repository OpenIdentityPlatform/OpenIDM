 <title>The Full Stack Sample</title>

 <indexterm>
  <primary>Samples</primary>
  <secondary>Full Stack Sample (OpenAM, OpenDJ, OpenIDM)</secondary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>
  This sample demonstrates the integration of three ForgeRock products: OpenIDM,
  OpenDJ, and OpenAM. With this sample, you can see how you can use OpenAM for
  authentication, for users maintained with OpenIDM, based on a data store of
  users in OpenDJ.
 </para>

 <para>
  It may take some time to set up this sample. The instructions that follow
  describe how you set up OpenDJ with a custom data store, sync that to OpenIDM.
  You will also configure OpenAM to use that same instance of OpenDJ. When you
  finish this sample, you will know how make OpenIDM, OpenDJ, and OpenAM work
  together. When your setup is complete, OpenIDM will authorize, and OpenAM will
  protect your users.
 </para>

 <para>
  Now let us get started. In this sample, you will integrate OpenDJ as the
  data store for both OpenIDM and OpenAM.
 </para>

 <para>
  OpenAM requires the use of a Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). For this
  sample, you may set up FQDNs for OpenAM, OpenDJ, and OpenIDM on either an
  appropriate DNS server or the <filename>hosts</filename> file for each
  system.
 </para>

 <para>
  This sample assumes that you have assigned the following FQDNs to the
  OpenAM, OpenDJ, and OpenIDM systems, respectively:
 </para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para><literal>openam.example.com</literal></para>
  </listitem>

  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para><literal>openidm.example.com</literal></para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>
  This sample assumes that you set up OpenIDM in a "two-way" mapping with an
  instance of OpenDJ, in a fashion similar to Sample 2b or 2c. It also assumes
  that you configure OpenAM to use the same instance of OpenDJ as its data store.
 </para>

 <para>
  To prepare this sample, you should first prepare OpenDJ and OpenAM. You will
  then start and customize OpenIDM configuration files via the Admin UI, or
  alternatively, via a text editor.
 </para>

  <para>
   You need to configure the OpenDJ server with write access. This allows you to
   create users from OpenIDM or OpenAM on the same LDAP server. When you

   Stack sample:
   (<filename>openidm/samples/fullStack/data/Example.ldif.</filename>)

  <para>
   When you configure OpenAM, you need the following information to configure
   OpenDJ as an external data store:

  <section xml:id="configure-fullstack-config">
   <title>Configuring the OPENAM_SESSION Module with Configuration Files</title>

   <para>
    To configure the <literal>OPENAM_SESSION</literal> module, you will need to
    configure two different files: <filename>authentication.json</filename> and
    <filename>ui-configuration.json</filename>. You can find those files in the
    <literal>samples/fullStack/conf</literal> directory.
   </para>

   <section xml:id="configure-fullstack-authjson">
    <title>Changes to authentication.json</title>

    <para>
     Under <literal>"authModules"</literal>, find the
     <literal>"OPENAM_SESSION"</literal> authentication module. The default
     version of the <filename>authentication.json</filename> file includes one
     entry which you will probably change, to match the URL of your instance of
     OpenAM:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">"authModules" : [
   {
     "name" : "OPENAM_SESSION",
     "properties" : {
       "openamDeploymentUrl" : "http://example.com:8081/openam",

           "cn=idmAdmins,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"
         ]
       },</programlisting>

    <para>
     Based on a standard <literal>openidm-admin</literal> user and a URL for
     OpenAM of openam.example.com, you would change the code snippet to:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">"authModules" : [
   {
     "name" : "OPENAM_SESSION",
     "properties" : {

         ]
       },</programlisting>

    <para>
     Do remember to include the configured OpenAM webapps subdirectory,
     typically <literal>/openam</literal>, in the
     <literal>"openamDeploymentUrl"</literal>. After the Java EE container used
     for OpenAM starts, it unpacks a file such as <literal>openam.war</literal>
     so that you can access it on the <literal>/openam</literal> endpoint.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <literal>"openamDeploymentUrl"</literal> shown above assumes that you
     are using SSL. If you have a signed certificate, you should import that
     into the OpenIDM truststore file. For more information, see
     the following section of the Integrator's Guide:

     <para>
      You should change at least the <literal>"openamLoginUrl"</literal> URL
      to match the login URL of your instance of OpenAM. If you want
      users to connect, securely, to the openam.example.com FQDN, on the

   </para>

   <para>
    If you want to configure this provisioner from the Admin UI, navigate to

   <para>
    Edit connector details as required. For consistency, with OpenAM
    requirements, you should change the <literal>Host name or IP</literal> to
    match the FQDN of your configured instance of OpenDJ, opendj.example.com.
    Be consistent with the <literal>Port</literal> number; if you set this port
    to 1389, do configure OpenDJ to communicate over the same port. Do configure
    OpenAM to use the same data store.
   </para>

   <para>
    Open the noted provisioner file from the
    <literal>samples/fullStack/conf</literal> directory. The default version of
    this file should look similar to the following:
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">
"configurationProperties" : {
    "host" : "localhost",
    "port" : 1389,
    "ssl" : false,

    ],
    "baseContextsToSynchronize" : [
        "dc=example,dc=com"
    ],</programlisting>

   <para>
    This snippet already matches the noted base context of
    <literal>"dc=example,dc=com"</literal> with a principal of
    <literal>"cn=Directory Manager"</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Make sure that the following settings are consistent with the
    way you have configured OpenDJ and OpenAM.
   </para>

   <para>
    Change the <literal>"localhost"</literal> entry to the
    FQDN where OpenDJ is installed. In this case, that FQDN is
    <literal>opendj.example.com</literal>. Depending on whether you want to
    set up communications over a regular or secure LDAP port, you might
    change the <literal>"port"</literal> number to to something like 1389 or
    1636. The following excerpt illustrates the change to an LDAP connector
    configuration:
   </para>

   <programlisting language="javascript">

   <para>
    If you want to configure secure communications between OpenIDM
    and OpenDJ, do remember to configure OpenDJ to communicate securely.
   </para>

   <para>
    When configuring OpenDJ, you may have a self-signed certificate.
    You may even have a certificate from a Certificate Authority. In either
    case, import that OpenDJ certificate into the OpenIDM truststore. For more
