Workflow Sample
===============

This sample demonstrates a typical use case of a workflow for provisioning.  After starting this sample, the first
step is to load users from the XML file into your managed/user store, like so:

curl -k -H "Content-type: application/json" -u "openidm-admin:openidm-admin" -X POST "https://localhost:8443/openidm/recon?_action=recon&mapping=systemXmlfileAccounts_managedUser"

This will create two users: user1 and manager1.  Both have the same password, "Welcome1".

This sample also adds two new business roles to the configuration : "manager" and "employee".  User1 is an employee and manager1 is 
a manager.

Employees have access to initiate a "Contract Onboarding" process.  This is a request to add a contractor to the system, with an 
option to include them in the xml file.  Once the form is completed, the request is sent for manager approval.  Any user with the 
"manager" role can claim this task.  Manager1 is our only manager, so login with that user and claim the task.  You may then
either approve or deny the request.  If approved, the user will be created in the managed/user store.  If it was requested that
the user be provisioned into the XML file, then that will also be done.  You can now login as the new user and see the notification
display informing the user of the dates they have been granted.  Also, user1 will be notified of the result of the manager's decision.


This workflow uses embedded templates to build a more sophisticated input form.  This is how the form is being validated with the
server-side policy rules.
