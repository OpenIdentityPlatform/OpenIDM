 <title>Managing Users, Groups, and Roles</title>

 <para>
  OpenIDM does not control the structure of objects that are stored in its
  repository. You can define any kind of managed object, but a definition for
  users, groups and roles is provided by default. Managed objects, and their
  properties are defined in your project's
  <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file.
 </para>
 <para>
  This chapter describes how to work with the default managed objects that are
  provided with OpenIDM. More information about the OpenIDM object model is
  provided in the <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="integrators-guide#appendix-objects"
                        xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Data Models and
  Objects Reference</citetitle></link>.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="working-with-managed-users">
  <title>Working with Managed Users</title>
  <para>
   External users that are stored in OpenIDM's repository are referred to as
   <firstterm>managed users</firstterm>. For a JDBC repository, OpenIDM stores
   managed users in the <literal>managedobjects</literal> table. A second table,
   <literal>managedobjectproperties</literal>, serves as the index table. For an
   OrientDB repository, managed users are stored in the
   <literal>managed_user</literal> table.
  </para>
  <para>
   OpenIDM provides RESTful access to managed users, at the context path
   <literal>/openidm/managed/user</literal>. For more information, see
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#first-steps-with-rest"
         xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>To Get Started
    With the OpenIDM REST Interface</citetitle></link> in the
   <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="working-with-groups">
  <title>Working With Managed Groups</title>
  <para>
   OpenIDM provides support for a managed <literal>"group"</literal> object. For
   a JDBC repository, OpenIDM stores managed groups with all other managed
   objects, in the <literal>managedobjects</literal> table, and uses the
   <literal>managedobjectproperties</literal> for indexing. For an OrientDB
   repository, managed groups are stored in the <literal>managed_group</literal>
   table.
  </para>
  <para>
   The managed group object is not provided by default. To use managed groups,
   add an object similar to the following to your
   <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file:
  </para>
  <programlisting>{
   "name" : "group"
   },
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   With this addition, OpenIDM provides RESTful access to managed groups, at the
   context path <literal>/openidm/managed/group</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For an example of a deployment that uses managed groups, see <link
   xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#more-sample2d"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Sample 2d -

   Guide</citetitle>.

 <section xml:id="configuring-custom-roles">
  <title>Configuring Custom Roles</title>
  <para>
   The default managed object model includes a managed <literal>role</literal>
   object that can be manipulated in the same way as any other managed object.
  </para>
  <para>
   This section refers to two distinct types of roles - direct (static) and
   indirect (dynamic) roles. Direct roles refer to roles that are specifically
   added to the user's <literal>"roles"</literal> attribute by an administrator
   operation. Indirect roles might be added to the user entry as a result of a
   script or rule that assigns the role. For example, a user might acquire a
   <literal>"sales-role"</literal> as a result of being in the
   <literal>"sales"</literal> organization.
  </para>
  <para>
   A managed user's <literal>"roles"</literal> attribute takes an array as a
   value. Currently, only flat strings are supported in this array.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <literal>"roles"</literal> attribute includes any specifically assigned
   roles, and any roles assigned internally by OpenIDM. So, the
   <literal>"roles"</literal> attribute of a particular user entry might
   appear as follows:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="java">
   "roles" : [
   "managed/role/sample-role",
   "openidm-authorized"
   ]
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   A role value that includes a <literal>/</literal> character is considered to
   be a URL that points to the role details on the router, for example,
   <literal>managed/role/sample-role</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The following sections describe basic role manipulation - how roles are
   defined, assigned to users, and deleted. The entitlements or assignments
   supplied by roles are described in the subsequent section.
  </para>

  <section xml:id="roles-creating-assigning-deleting">
   <title>Creating, Assigning, and Deleting Roles</title>
   <para>
    Role definitions are stored in the repository and are accessible at the
    <literal>/openidm/managed/role</literal> context path. This section
    describes how to manipulate roles over the REST interface.
   </para>
   <para>
    The examples in this section assume that OpenIDM has been started with the
    configuration of Sample 2b, and refers to the managed user objects created
    in that sample. For more information, see <link xlink:show="new"
                                                    xlink:href="install-guide#more-sample2b"

    <title>To Create a Role Definition</title>
    <para>
     To create a managed role definition, use a PUT request on the
     <literal>openidm/managed/role</literal> context path, specifying the role
     ID in the URL. The following request creates a role definition named
     <literal>newrole</literal>. The role effectively assigns the value
     <literal>"CN=employees,O=corp"</literal> to the
     <literal>ldapGroups</literal> attribute on the <literal>ldap</literal>
     system.

     Most of the examples in this guide use PUT to create client-assigned IDs

     use a POST request. For more information, see

    <title>Virtual Role Attributes</title>
    <para>
     Based on the set of role definitions that are assigned to a specific user,
     the roles mechanism generates two virtual attributes on the user entry -
     <literal>effectiveRoles</literal> and
     <literal>effectiveAssignments</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The logic that calculates the <literal>effectiveRoles</literal> and
     <literal>effectiveAssignments</literal> attribute values is located in two
     scripts:
     <filename>openidm/bin/defaults/script/roles/effectiveRoles.js</filename>
     and
     <filename>openidm/bin/defaults/script/roles/effectiveAssignments.js</filename>.
     Do not alter these scripts. If you need to modify how roles and assignments
     are handled, create your own custom script and reference it in the
     <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file. For information about using
     custom scripts, see the
     <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#appendix-scripting"
           xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Scripting
      Reference</citetitle></link>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <literal>effectiveRoles</literal> attribute lists the specific role
     definitions that are applied to a user entry. By default, the effective
     roles script supports direct role assignments only. Dynamic role assignment
     is not provided out of the box, but can be added with a custom script that
     overrides the default <filename>effectiveRoles.js</filename> script. For
     more information, see <xref linkend="dynamic-role-assignments" />.
    </para>
    <para>
     Based on the effective roles, the <literal>effectiveAssignments</literal>
     attribute provides the calculated resource assignments, that is the
     amalgamated set of entitlements for a specific user.
    </para>
    <para>
     The value of the <literal>effectiveAssignments</literal> attribute provides
     the information required for the provisioner to apply the effective
     assignments, and provides a reference to the source of the assignment. In
     reading this attribute, it is therefore possible to find and change the
     root source of an assignment.
    </para>
    <para>
     Effective assignments can merge attribute operations on the same system from
     multiple roles. For example, role A might add group A to a user's group
     membership list, and role B might add group B to the same group membership
     property on the same assigned system.
    </para>
    <para>
     The effective roles and effective assignments attributes are configured in
     <filename>openidm/conf/managed.json</filename> as follows:
    </para>

          "file" : "roles/effectiveAssignments.js",
          "effectiveRolesPropName" : "effectiveRoles"
     }
}
    </programlisting>

    <para>
     By default, the <filename>effectiveRoles.js</filename> script uses the
     <literal>"roles"</literal> attribute of a user entry to determine the
     direct roles assigned to the user. The
     <filename>effectiveAssignments.js</filename> script uses the virtual
     <literal>"effectiveRoles"</literal> attribute of the user entry to calculate
     the user's effective assignments. If your deployment uses different
     attributes to store this information, change the
     <literal>"rolesPropName"</literal> and the
     <literal>"effectiveRolesPropName"</literal> properties of the virtual
     attribute definitions accordingly.
    </para>

    <para>
     When a user entry is assigned a role, the <literal>effectiveRoles</literal>
     and <literal>effectiveAssignments</literal> of that entry are calculated
     according to the role definition. A managed user entry, whose roles have
     been generated based on the role definition illustrated previously, might
     appear as follows:

    Note that changes to dynamic role assignments for existing users require a
    manual reconciliation of the affected group of users for those changes to
    take effect. So, if a new dynamic role definition is created, if an
    existing dynamic role definition is changed, or if changes are made to the
    dynamic assignment rule, the group of users affected by that assignment
    rule must be reconciled manually.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a user entry is changed or synchronized, however, all dynamic role
    assignments are reassessed automatically.

   <title>Managed Role Object Script Hooks</title>
   <para>
    In addition to the functionality provided by the assignments, a managed
    role object has script hooks that enable you to configure role behavior.
    The managed role object has the following structure in the managed objects
    configuration file (<filename>managed.json</filename>):
   </para>
   <programlisting language="javascript">{
    "name" : "role",
    "postCreate" : {
        "type" : "text/javascript",
        "file" : "roles/update-users-of-role.js"
    },
    "postUpdate" : {
        "type" : "text/javascript",
        "file" : "roles/update-users-of-role.js"
    },
    "postDelete" : {
        "type" : "text/javascript",
        "file" : "roles/update-users-of-role.js"
    }
}</programlisting>
   <para>
    The <literal>"postCreate"</literal>, <literal>"postUpdate"</literal>, and
    <literal>"postDelete"</literal> properties enable you to specify what
    should happen when a role definition is created, updated, or deleted. By
    default, the <filename>update-users-of-role.js</filename> script runs in
    each of these cases.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <filename>update-users-of-role.js</filename> script includes a
    <literal>triggerSyncCheck</literal> attribute, which reviews the
    <literal>effectiveRoles</literal> and <literal>effectiveAssignments</literal>
    virtual attributes, to determine whether OpenIDM should run a
    synchronization operation on these attributes.
   </para>
   <para>
    This script iterates over all managed users, locates the users who have
    been assigned this role, and regenerates their effective assignments on the
    target resource. So, for example, if the role <literal>"ldap"</literal>
    gives a user an assignment on the resource "Active Directory", when that
    role definition is changed, a reconciliation operation runs to update the
    assignment for that user on the "Active Directory" resource.

  <para>
   OpenIDM supports reversible encryption of attribute values for managed
   objects. Attribute values that might be encrypted include passwords,
   authentication questions, credit card numbers, and social security numbers.
   If passwords are already encrypted on the external resource, they are
   generally excluded from the synchronization process. For more information,
   see <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-passwords"

  </para>
  <para>
   You configure encryption in the managed object configuration (in the
   <filename>conf/managed.json</filename> file). The following extract of that
   file shows a managed object configuration that encrypts and decrypts
   <literal>securityAnswer</literal>, <literal>ssn</literal>, and
   <literal>password</literal> attributes using the default symmetric
   key, and additional scripts for extra passwords.

 <section xml:id="restricting-http-access">
  <title>Restricting HTTP Access to Sensitive Data</title>
  <para>
   You can protect specific sensitive managed data by marking the corresponding
   properties as "private". Private data, whether it is encrypted or not, is not
   accessible over the REST interface. Properties that are marked as private are
   removed from an object when that object is retrieved over REST.
  </para>
  <para>
   To mark a property as private, set its <literal>"scope"</literal> to
   <literal>"private"</literal> in the <filename>conf/managed.json</filename>
   file.
  </para>
  <para>
   The following extract of the <filename>managed.json</filename> file shows how
   HTTP access is prevented on the <literal>password</literal> and
   <literal>securityAnswer</literal> properties.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="javascript">
"properties" : [
   {
      "name" : "securityAnswer",
      "encryption" : {
         "key" : "openidm-sym-default"
      },
      "scope" : "private"
   },
   {
      "name" : "password",
      "encryption" : {
         "key" : "openidm-sym-default"
      },
      "scope" : "private"
   },
...</programlisting>
  <para>
   A potential caveat with using private properties is that private properties
   are <emphasis>removed</emphasis> if an object is updated by using an HTTP
   <literal>PUT</literal> request. A <literal>PUT</literal> request replaces the
   entire object in the repository. Because properties that are marked as
   private are ignored in HTTP requests, these properties are effectively
   removed from the object when the update is done. To work around this
   limitation, do not use <literal>PUT</literal> requests if you have configured
   private properties. Instead, use a <literal>PATCH</literal> request to update
   only those properties that need to be changed.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, to update the <literal>givenName</literal> of user jdoe, you
   could run the following command:
  </para>
  <screen>$ <userinput>curl \
--cacert self-signed.crt \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
--header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '[
   {
   "operation":"replace",
   "field":"/givenName",
   "value":"Jon"
   }
]' \
"https://localhost:8443/openidm/managed/user?_action=patch&amp;_queryId=for-userName&amp;uid=jdoe"</userinput>
  </screen>
  <note>
   <para>
    The filtering of private data applies only to direct HTTP read and query
    calls on managed objects. No automatic filtering is done for internal
    callers, and the data that these callers choose to expose.
