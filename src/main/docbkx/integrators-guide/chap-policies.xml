 <title>Using Policies to Validate Data</title>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Policies</primary>
 </indexterm>

  <para>OpenIDM provides an extensible policy service that enables you to 
  apply specific validation requirements to various components and properties. 
  The policy service provides a REST interface for reading policy requirements 
  and validating the properties of components against configured policies. 
  Objects and properties are validated automatically when they are created, 
  updated, or patched. Policies can be applied to user passwords, but also to 
  any kind of managed object.</para>
  
  <para>The policy service enables you to do the following:</para>
 
 <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
     <para>Read the configured policy requirements of a specific component.
     </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>Read the configured policy requirements of all components.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>Validate a component object against the configured policies.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
     <para>Validate the properties of a component against the configured 
     policies.</para>
   </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

 <para>
  A default policy applies to all managed objects. You can configure the
  default policy to suit your requirements, or you can extend the policy
  service by supplying your own scripted policies.

   To apply policies to additional objects such as the audit service, you should
   modify the <filename>conf/router.json</filename> file.

        <para>
         A policy configuration object, which defines each element of the policy.

        <para>
         A policy implementation function, which describes the requirements that

      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>Together, the configuration object and the implementation function 
      determine whether an object is valid in terms of the policy. The following

    You can extend the policy service by adding your own scripted policies in

    manipulating the default policy script file (in
    <literal>bin/defaults/script</literal>) as doing so might result in
    interoperability issues in a future release. To reference additional policy
    scripts, set the <literal>"additionalFiles"</literal> property in
    <filename>conf/policy.json</filename>.

    <title>Disabling Policy Enforcement</title>
    
     <para>Policy enforcement refers to the automatic validation of data in 
     the repository when it is created, updated, or patched. In certain 
     situations you might want to disable policy enforcement temporarily. You 
     might, for example, want to import existing data that does not meet the 
     validation requirements with the intention of cleaning up this data at a 
     later stage.</para>
       
     <para>You can disable policy enforcement by setting 
     <literal>openidm.policy.enforcement.enabled</literal> to 
     <literal>false</literal> in the <filename>conf/boot/boot.properties</filename> 
     file. This setting disables policy enforcement in the back-end only, and 
     has no impact on direct policy validation calls to the Policy Service 
     (which the user interface makes to validate input fields). So, with policy 
     enforcement disabled, data added directly over REST is not subject to 
     validation, but data added with the UI is still subject to validation.
