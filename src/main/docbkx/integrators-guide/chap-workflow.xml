 <para>Key to any identity management solution is the ability to provide
 workflow-driven provisioning activities, whether for self-service actions
 such as requests for entitlements, roles or resources, running sunrise or
 sunset processes, handling approvals with escalations, or performing
 maintenance.</para>
 
 <para>OpenIDM provides an embedded workflow and business process engine
 based on Activiti and the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0
 standard.</para>
 
 <para>More information about Activiti and the Activiti project can be found
 at <link xlink:href="http://www.activiti.org" xlink:show="new" />.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="about-bmpm-2-activiti">
  <title>BPMN 2.0 and the Activiti Tools</title>

  <para>Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 is the result of consensus
  among Business Process Management (BPM) system vendors. The <link
  xlink:href="http://omg.org/" xlink:show="new">Object Management Group</link>
  (OMG) has developed and maintained the <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/">BPMN</link> standard since
  2004.</para>

  <para>The first version of the BPMN specification focused only on graphical
  notation, and quickly became popular with the business analyst audience.
  BPMN 1.x defines how constructs such as human tasks, executable scripts, and
  automated decisions are visualized in a vendor-neutral, standard way. The
  second version of BPMN extends that focus to include execution semantics,
  and a common exchange format. Thus, BPMN 2.0 process definition models
  can be exchanged not only between different graphical editors, but can also
  be executed as is on any BPMN 2.0-compliant engine, such as the engine
  embedded in OpenIDM.</para>

  <para>Using BPMN 2.0, you can add artifacts describing workflow and business
  process behavior to OpenIDM for provisioning and other purposes. For example,
  you can craft the actual artifacts defining business processes and workflow
  in a text editor, or using a special Eclipse plugin. The Eclipse plugin 
  provides visual design capabilities, simplifying packaging and deployment of 
  the artifact to OpenIDM. See the <link
  xlink:href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ACT/Activiti+BPMN+2.0+Eclipse+Plugin"
  xlink:show="new">Activiti BPMN 2.0 Eclipse Plugin</link> documentation for
  instructions on installing Activiti Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Designer.</para>
  
  <para>Also, read the Activiti <citetitle>User Guide</citetitle> section
  covering <link xlink:href="http://www.activiti.org/userguide/#bpmnConstructs"
  xlink:show="new"><citetitle>BPMN 2.0 Constructs</citetitle></link>, which
  describes in detail the graphical notations and XML representations for
  events, flows, gateways, tasks, and process constructs.</para>

  <para>
   With the latest version of Activiti, JavaScript tasks can be added to
   workflow definitions. However, OpenIDM functions cannot be called from a
   JavaScript task in a workflow. Therefore, you can use JavaScript for
   non-OpenIDM workflow tasks, but you must use the
   <literal>activiti:expression</literal> construct to call OpenIDM functions.

  <title>Setting Up Activiti Integration With OpenIDM</title>

  <para>
   OpenIDM embeds an Activiti Process Engine that is started in the OpenIDM OSGi
   container.
  </para>

  <para>
   After OpenIDM has been installed (as described in the
   <link xlink:href="install-guide#chap-install"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Installation
   Guide</citetitle></link>), start OpenIDM, and run the

...</screen>
  
  <para>
   OpenIDM reads workflow definitions from the
   <literal>/path/to/openidm/workflow</literal> directory. To test workflow
   integration, at least one workflow definition must exist in this directory.
  </para>
  <para>
   A sample workflow (<filename>example.bpmn20.xml</filename>) is provided in
   the <literal>/path/to/openidm/samples/misc</literal> directory. Copy this
   workflow to the <literal>/path/to/openidm/workflow</literal> directory to
   test the workflow integration.
  </para>
  
  <screen>$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ cp samples/misc/example.bpmn20.xml workflow/</screen>
  
  <para>
   Verify the workflow integration by using the REST API. The following
   REST call lists the defined workflows:
  </para>
  
  <screen>$ <userinput>curl \
 --cacert self-signed.crt \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin" \
 --header "X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin" \
 --request GET \
 "https://localhost:8443/openidm/workflow/processdefinition?_queryId=query-all-ids"
  </userinput></screen>
  <para>
   The sample workflow definition that you copied in the previous step is named
   <literal>osgiProcess</literal>. The result of the preceding REST call
   therefore includes output similar to the following:
  </para>
  
  <screen><computeroutput>{
...
  "result":[
     {
        ...

        "_id":"osgiProcess:1:3",
        ...
     }
        ]
}</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>
   The <literal>osgiProcess</literal> workflow calls OpenIDM, queries the
   available workflow definitions from Activiti, then prints the list of
   workflow definitions to the OpenIDM logs. Invoke the <literal>osgiProcess
  </literal> workflow with the following REST call:
  </para>
  
  <screen>$ <userinput>curl \

  <para>
   The workflow prints the list of workflow definitions to the OpenIDM console.
   With the default sample, you should see something like this on the console:

  </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>

   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Package the workflow definition file as a <literal>.bar</literal> file
     (Business Archive File). If you are using Eclipse to define the workflow, a
     <literal>.bar</literal> file is created when you select "Create deployment
     artifacts". A <literal>.bar</literal> file is essentially the same as a

  <title>Invoking Activiti Workflows</title>
  <para>
   You can invoke workflows and business processes from any trigger point within
   OpenIDM, including reacting to situations discovered during reconciliation.
   Workflows can be invoked from script files, using the
   <literal>openidm.create()</literal> function, or directly from the REST

var params = {
 "_key": "myWorkflow"
};

openidm.create('workflow/processinstance', null, params);
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   The <literal>null</literal> in this example indicates that you do not want to

    used when a new workflow instance is started.
   </para>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <literal>_key</literal> specifies the <literal>id</literal> attribute of
     the workflow process definition, for example:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="javascript">
&lt;process id="sendNotificationProcess" name="Send Notification Process"&gt;
    </programlisting>
    <para>
     If there is more than one workflow definition with the same
     <literal>_key</literal> parameter, the latest deployed version of the
     workflow definition is invoked.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <literal>_processDefinitionId</literal> specifies the ID that is generated
     by the Activiti Process Engine when a workflow definition is deployed, for
     example:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="javascript">
"sendNotificationProcess:1:104";
    </programlisting>
    <para>
     To obtain the <literal>processDefinitionId</literal>, query the available

    </programlisting>
    <para>
     If you specify a <literal>_key</literal> and a
     <literal>_processDefinitionId</literal>, the
     <literal>_processDefinitionId</literal> is used because it is more precise.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Use the optional <literal>_businessKey</literal> parameter to add specific
   business logic information to the workflow when it is invoked. For example,
   the following workflow invocation assigns the workflow a business key of
   <literal>"newOrder"</literal>. This business key can later be used to query
   "newOrder" processes.
  </para>
  <screen><userinput>$ curl \

  <title>Querying Activiti Workflows</title>

  <para>
   The Activiti implementation supports filtered queries that enable you to
   query the running process instances and tasks, based on specific query
   parameters. To perform a filtered query send a GET request to the
   <literal>workflow/processinstance</literal> context path, including the query
   in the URL.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, the following query returns all process instances

  </screen>  
  <para>
   Any Activiti properties can be queried using the same notation, for example,
   <literal>processDefinitionId=managedUserApproval:1:6405</literal>. The query
   syntax applies to all queries with <literal>_queryId=filtered-query</literal>.
   The following query returns all process instances that were started by the

 <section xml:id="activiti-custom-templates">
  <title>Using Custom Templates for Activiti Workflows</title>
  <para>
   The embedded Activiti engine is integrated with the default user interface.
   For simple workflows, you can use the standard Activiti form properties, and
   have the UI render the corresponding generic forms automatically. If you
   require a more complex form template, (including input validation,
   rich input field types, complex CSS, and so forth) you must define a custom
   form template.
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>
    There are two ways in which you can define custom form templates for your
    workflows:
   </para>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Create an HTML template, and refer to that template in the workflow
     definition.
    </para>
    <para>
     This is the recommended method of creating custom form templates. To refer
     to the HTML template in the workflow definition, use the
     <literal>activiti:formKey</literal> attribute, for example
     <literal>activiti:formKey="nUCStartForm.xhtml"</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>The HTML file must be deployed as part of the workflow definition.
     Create a .zip file that contains the HTML template and the workflow
     definition file. Rename the .zip file with a .bar extension.
    </para>
    <para>
     For a sample workflow that uses external, referenced form templates, see
     <literal>samples/usecase/workflow/newUserCreate.bpmn20.xml</literal>. The
     HTML templates, and the corresponding .bar file are included in that
     directory.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Use an embedded template within the workflow definition.
    </para>
    <para>
     This method is not ideal, because the HTML code must be escaped, and is
     difficult to read, edit, or maintain, as a result. Also, sections of HTML
     code will most likely need to be duplicated if your workflow includes
     multiple task stages. However, you might want to use this method if your
     form is small, not too complex and you do not want to bother with creating
     a separate HTML file and .bar deployment.

    <para>
     OpenIDM picks up workflow definitions from the files located in the
     <filename>/path/to/openidm/workflow</filename> directory. If you delete the
     workflow definition (<filename>.xml</filename> file) from this directory,
     the OSGI bundle is deleted. However, deleting this file does not remove the
     workflow definition from the Activiti engine. You must therefore delete the
     definition over REST, as shown in the following example.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note that, although there is only one representation of a workflow
     definition in the file system, there might be several versions of the same
     definition in Activiti. If you want to delete redundant process
     definitions, delete the definition over REST, <emphasis>making sure that
     you do not delete the latest version</emphasis>.

   <title>Sample Workflow - Provisioning User Accounts</title>
   <para>
    This example, provided in <filename>openidm/samples/workflow</filename>,
    uses workflows to provision user accounts. The example demonstrates the use
    of the browser-based user interface to manage workflows.
   </para>
    
   <section xml:id="provisioning-sample-overview">
    <title>Overview of the Sample</title>
    <para>
     The sample starts with a reconciliation process that loads user accounts
     from an XML file into the managed users repository. The reconciliation
     creates two users, with UIDs <literal>user1</literal> and
     <literal>manager1</literal>. Both users have the same password
     (<literal>Welcome1</literal>).
    </para>
    <para>
     The sample adds two new business roles to the configuration -
     <literal>employee</literal> (assigned to <literal>user1</literal>) and
     <literal>manager</literal> (assigned to <literal>manager1</literal>).
    </para>
    <para>
     As part of the provisioning, employees are required to initiate a
     "Contract Onboarding" process. This process is a request to add a
     contractor to the managed users repository, with an option to include the
     contractor in the original data source (the XML file).
    </para>
    <para>
     When the employee has completed the required form, the request is sent to
     the manager for approval. Any user with the role
     <literal>"manager"</literal> can claim the approval task. If the request is
     approved, the user is created in the managed users repository. If a request
     was made to add the user to the original data source (the XML file) this is
     done in a subsequent step.
    </para>
    <para>
     The workflow uses embedded templates to build a more sophisticated input
     form.  The form is validated with the server-side policy rules, described
     in <link xlink:href="integrators-guide#chap-policies"
     xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Using

  <title>Workflow Use Cases</title>
  <para>
   This section describes a number of sample workflows, that demonstrate typical
   use cases for OpenIDM. The use cases, provided in
   <filename>/path/to/openidm/samples/usecase</filename>, work together to
   provide a complete business story, with the same set of sample data. Each of
   the use cases is integrated with the default UI.
  </para>
  <para>
   These use cases use OrientDB as a repository by default. Alternative
   repository configuration files are provided in
   <filename>/path/to/openidm/samples/usecase/db</filename>. If you want to use
   one of these alternative repositories, remove the
   <filename>repo.orientdb.json</filename> file from the <literal>conf/</literal>
   directory of the use case you are testing (for example,
   <filename>samples/usecase/usecase1/conf/repo.orientdb.json</filename>) and
   copy the appropriate JDBC repository configuration file
   (<filename>repo.jdbc.json</filename>) into that <literal>conf/</literal>
   directory. For more information on using an alternative repository, see
   <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#chap-repository"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Installing a
   Repository For Production</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Installation
   Guide</citetitle>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Run use case 1 before running any of the other use cases. Use cases 2 through
   6 depend on the <filename>hr_data.ldif</filename> file that you will import
   and reconcile when you run use case 1.
  </para>
  <para>
   The use cases assume an initial data set of twenty "ordinary" managed users
   in OpenIDM (user.0 - user.19). The users are divided as follows:

   <title>Use Case 2 - New User Onboarding</title>
   <para>
    This use case demonstrates a new user onboarding process. The process can be
    initiated by any of the users created in the previous reconciliation
    process. In this example, we use <literal>user.1</literal> to initiate the
    process. <literal>user.1</literal> captures the details of a new user, and
    then submits the new user entry for approval by the prospective manager of
    that new user.
   </para>
   <para>
    The use case includes three separate workflows - onboarding (creation of the
    new user), sunrise (new user start date) and sunset (user end date).
   </para>
   <para>
    The use case also demonstrates email notification with the optional
    configuration of an external email service. If you want to use email
    notification, you must configure the external email service, as described in
    <xref linkend="configure-email-notification" />, before you start the
    workflow.

    The use case works with the OpenIDM Data Management UI. If you deploy OpenIDM

      <emphasis>Department</emphasis>. Specifies one of four departments to
      which the new user will belong (Human Resources, Production Planning,
      Sales &amp; Distribution, or Treasury &amp; Payments). The value you
      select here determines the "manager" of the new user, to which the request
      will be sent for approval. (See the previous table of users for a list of
      the managers of the various departments.)
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis>User Type</emphasis>. Governs user access to specific accounts.
      If the User Type is "Employee", the new user will have access to an
      account named "Business". This access is represented as an attribute of
      the managed user entry in the OpenIDM repository, as follows:
      <literal>accounts : ["Business"]</literal>. If the User Type is
      "Contractor", the new user will have no accounts associated with its
      managed user representation in OpenIDM.

     <para>
      <emphasis>Send Email Notification</emphasis>. Indicates whether an email
      should be sent to alert the manager of the new required approval. The
      email details used here are defined when you configure email notification,

      When the new user request has been approved, the user is created in the

      approval, you should now be able to log into the UI with the details of
      the new user. If you included a Start Date, you need to complete the

    <title>Initiating the Sunset Workflow</title>
    <para>
     If a sunset date is set for the new user, you can trigger the sunset
     workflow to deactivate the user account when the end of his work period is
     reached.
    </para>
    <step>
     <para>
      To trigger the sunset workflow, enable the sunset task scanning schedule.
      The schedule is disabled by default.
     </para>
     <para>
      Modify the schedule configuration file
      (<filename>samples/usecase/usecase2/conf/schedule-taskscan_sunset.json</filename>),
      setting the <literal>"enabled"</literal> property to <literal>true</literal>.
     </para>

$ grep "enabled" samples/usecase/usecase2/conf/schedule-taskscan_sunset.json
     </userinput>
<computeroutput>"enabled" : true,</computeroutput></screen>
     <para>
      The scan runs every minute, and checks the repository for users that have
      a sunset date that is anything up to one day after the current date.
      When the scan is triggered, it locates users whose contracts are about to
      end, and starts the sunset workflow on these users. When the workflow is
      initiated, it assigns a task to the manager of the affected user. In this
      example, the task is assigned to <literal>user.0</literal>.
       </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      When the sunset schedule has been enabled, log into OpenIDM UI as
      <literal>user.0</literal> (with password <literal>Passw0rd</literal>). If
      the user's sunset date is within one day of the current date, a "Contract
      Termination" task becomes available under the 'My tasks' section for the
      manager of that user.
     </para>
     <para>
      Select the contract termination task and click Details.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      In the Decision field, select either "Accept termination" or
      "Modify date", then click Complete.
     </para>
     <para>
      When you accept the termination, the user's account status is set to
      <literal>inactive</literal> and the HR administrative user receives a
      notification to that effect, next time that user logs into the UI. The
      deactivated user is no longer able to log into the UI.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you select to modify the date, the sunset date of that user is changed
      to the value that you specify in the End Date field on that form. The
      management user receives a UI notification that the employee's contract
      has been extended.

   <title>Use Case 5 - Certification</title>
   <para>
    This use case includes two scheduled tasks that demonstrate a certification
    workflow.
   </para>
   <para>
    The first scheduled task fetches all the managed users and begins a
    certification workflow for each user. The workflow shows the roles that are
    assigned to each user and allows you to accept (certify) or change those
    role assignments. The second scheduled task fetches all the defined managed
    roles and begins a certification workflow for the roles. The workflow
    demonstrates managed role assignment.
   </para>
   <para>
    In this use case, four managed roles are defined, based on the departments
    to which the managed users belong. The managed roles are <literal>Human
    Resources</literal>, <literal>Production Planning</literal>,
    <literal>Sales and Distribution</literal>, and <literal>Treasury and
    Payments</literal>. Every user is assigned a dynamic role by default, which
    corresponds to that user's department.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     By default the scheduled tasks used in this workflow run every minute, so
     you will need to wait a minute before logging into the UI, after enabling
     the schedules. You can change the frequency by editing the
     <literal>"schedule"</literal> property in the schedule configuration files
     (<filename>schedule-certification.json</filename> and
     <filename>schedule-certificationEntitlements.json</filename>). This
     property takes standard cron syntax. Every minute, a new task is created
     for each user or role, so you will see several tasks in the group queue if
     you log in to the UI after some time. In a live deployment, this kind of
     workflow would probably only run once every few months.

   <title>Use Case 6 - Password Change Reminder</title>
   <para>
    This use case demonstrates using the task scanner to trigger a password
    change reminder workflow for managed users.
   </para>
   <para>
    In this example, each managed user entry in OpenIDM has a dedicated
    attribute, <literal>lastPasswordSet</literal>, that stores the date on which
    the password was last changed. The value of this attribute is updated by an
    <literal>onStore</literal> script, defined in the managed user configuration
    file (<filename>conf/managed.json</filename>), as follows:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
"onStore" : {
    "type" : "text/javascript",
    "file" : "script/onStoreManagedUser.js"
},
   </programlisting>
   <para>
    When a new password is stored for a user, the script sets the date on which
    this change was made. The task scanner periodically scans the
    <literal>lastPasswordSet</literal> attribute, and starts the workflow if the
    password was changed more than an hour ago. This condition is configured in
    the schedule configuration file
    (<filename>schedule-taskscan_passwordchange.json</filename>):
   </para>
   <screen><userinput>$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ more samples/usecase/usecase6/conf/schedule-taskscan_passwordchange.json</userinput>
<computeroutput>
...
"condition" : {
    "before" : "${Time.now - 1h}"
},
....</computeroutput>
   </screen>
   <para>
    Obviously, in a real deployment, the period between required password
    changes would be longer, and this value would need to be set accordingly.
    For the purposes of testing this use case, you might want to set the value
    to a shorter period, such as <literal>"${Time.now - 1m}"</literal>, which
    will send the notification one minute after a password change.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default, the workflow sends notifications to the user entry, visible when
    the user logs into the UI. If you want notifications sent by email,
    configure the external email service, as follows:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Edit the settings in the file
      <filename>/path/to/openidm/samples/usecase/usecase6/conf/external.email.json</filename>
      to match the settings of your mail server. For example:
     </para>
     <screen><userinput>$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ more samples/usecase/usecase6/conf/external.email.json</userinput>
<computeroutput>
{

        "port" : "587",
        "username" : "my-username"
        "password" : "my-password",
        "mail.smtp.auth" : "true",
        "mail.smtp.starttls.enable" : "true"
}</computeroutput>
     </screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Enable email notification in the script file that starts the workflow
      (<filename>samples/usecase/usecase6/script/passwordchange.js</filename>).
      For example:
     </para>
     <screen><userinput>$ cd /path/to/openidm
$ more samples/usecase/usecase6/script/passwordchange.js</userinput>
<computeroutput>
/*global  objectID*/
